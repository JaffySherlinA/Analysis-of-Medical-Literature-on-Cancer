Measuringcancerevolution from the genome.,"Trevor A Graham, Andrea Sottoriva, Trevor A Graham, Andrea Sottoriva","The temporal dynamics of cancer evolution remain elusive, because it is impractical to longitudinally observe cancers unperturbed by treatment. Consequently, our knowledge of how cancers grow largely derives from inferences made from a single point in time - the endpoint in the cancer's evolution, when it is removed from the body and studied in the laboratory. Fortuitously however, the cancer genome, by virtue of ongoing mutations that uniquely mark clonal lineages within the tumour, provides a rich, yet surreptitious, record of cancer development. In this review, we describe how a cancer's genome can be analysed to reveal the temporal history of mutation and selection, and discuss why both selective and neutral evolution feature prominently in carcinogenesis. We argue that selection in cancer can only be properly studied once we have some understanding of what the absence of selection looks like. We review the data describing punctuated evolution in cancer, and reason that punctuated phenotype evolution is consistent with both gradual and punctuated genome evolution. We conclude that, to map and predict evolutionary trajectories during carcinogenesis, it is critical to better understand the relationship between genotype change and phenotype change.

Cancerand cure: A critical analysis.,"P S Roy, B J Saikia, P S Roy, B J Saikia","Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of the 20th century and spreading further with continuance and increasing incidence in the 21st century. The situation is so alarming that every fourth person is having a lifetime risk of cancer. India registers more than 11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure is above 14 million worldwide. Is cancer curable? The short answer to this question is ""Yes."" In fact, all cancers are curable if they are caught early enough. Cancer cells continue to grow unless one of four things occur: (1) The cancerous mass is removed surgically; (2) using chemotherapy or another type of cancer-specific medication, such as hormonal therapy; (3) using radiation therapy; or (4) the cancer cells shrink and disappear on their own.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28244479/,2022
Fieldcancerizationin breastcancer.,"Emanuela Gadaleta, Graeme J Thorn, Helen Ross-Adams, Louise J Jones, Claude Chelala, Emanuela Gadaleta, Graeme J Thorn, Helen Ross-Adams, Louise J Jones, Claude Chelala","Breast cancer affects one in seven women worldwide during their lifetime. Widespread mammographic screening programs and education campaigns allow for early detection of the disease, often during its asymptomatic phase. Current practice in treatment and recurrence monitoring is based primarily on pathological evaluations but can also encompass genomic evaluations, both of which focus on the primary tumor. Although breast cancer is one of the most studied cancers, patients still recur at a rate of up to 15% within the first 10 years post-surgery. Local recurrence was originally attributed to tumor cells contaminating histologically normal (HN) tissues beyond the surgical margin, but advances in technology have allowed for the identification of distinct aberrations that exist in the peri-tumoral tissues themselves. One leading theory to explain this phenomenon is the field cancerization theory. Under this hypothesis, tumors arise from a field of molecularly altered cells that create a permissive environment for malignant evolution, which can occur with or without morphological changes. The traditional histopathology paradigm dictates that molecular alterations are reflected in the tissue phenotype. However, the spectrum of inter-patient variability of normal breast tissue may obfuscate recognition of a cancerized field during routine diagnostics. In this review, we explore the concept of field cancerization focusing on HN peri-tumoral tissues: we present the pathological and molecular features of field cancerization within these tissues and discuss how the use of peri-tumoral tissues can affect research. Our observations suggest that pathological and molecular evaluations could be used synergistically to assess risk and guide the therapeutic management of patients. © 2022 The Authors.

Tumor cell metabolism:cancer'sAchilles' heel.,"Guido Kroemer, Jacques Pouyssegur, Guido Kroemer, Jacques Pouyssegur","The essential hallmarks of cancer are intertwined with an altered cancer cell-intrinsic metabolism, either as a consequence or as a cause. As an example, the resistance of cancer mitochondria against apoptosis-associated permeabilization and the altered contribution of these organelles to metabolism are closely related. Similarly, the constitutive activation of signaling cascades that stimulate cell growth has a profound impact on anabolic metabolism. Here, we review the peculiarities of tumor cell metabolism that might be taken advantage of for cancer treatment. Specifically, we discuss the alterations in signal transduction pathways and/or enzymatic machineries that account for metabolic reprogramming of transformed cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//18538731/,2018
What IsCancer?,"Daniel M Hausman, Daniel M Hausman","This essay focuses on themes in Explaining Cancer: Finding Order in Disorder (2018) by Anya Plutynski, a monograph that has important things to say about both the peculiarities of cancers and our theories about them. Cancer's agents of destruction are human cells that have been recruited and to some extent transformed into pathological organisms or the building blocks of tumors. Cancers both undermine and exploit mechanisms of multicellular organization, and understanding them gives rise to difficult philosophical problems. In addition to sketching Plutynski's discussion of these problems, this essay defends Christopher Boorse's account of disease from Plutynski's criticisms, and it expresses some qualms about her treatment of scientific explanation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//31761807/,2016

Epidemiology ofCancer.,"Stephen M Schwartz, Stephen M Schwartz","Background:Cancers are a large and heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that collectively accounted for approximately 600 000 US deaths in 2020; only heart disease claimed more lives. A large amount of knowledge has accumulated regarding the epidemiology of most cancer types, including their causes.Content:The cancer types most frequently diagnosed among adults in most high-income countries are lung, colorectal, female breast, cutaneous melanoma, and prostate. In general cancer incidence and mortality is very low in children and adolescents, rising exponentially with increasing age during adulthood. There is marked international variation in the incidence of most cancers. The most important causes of cancer are tobacco use (primarily cigarette use), excess alcohol consumption, obesity, lack of physical activity, diets low in fruits and vegetables, infectious agents, and sun exposure. Early detection can reduce the chances that a person will die of cancers of the female breast, uterine cervix, colon and rectum, lung, and prostate.Summary:Although the most common cancers in the United States continue to have a substantial impact on public health, they are caused in whole or part by factors over which people and governments have control through choices they make. Among these are tobacco and alcohol use, obesity, diets low in fruits and vegetables and lack of physical activity, and sun exposure. Thus, a very large proportion of cancer's impact could be ameliorated if more people avoided these exposures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//38175589/,2017

Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation, and taking chemotherapeutic drugs, which often kill the healthy cells and result in toxicity in patients. Therefore, researchers are looking for ways to be able to eliminate just cancerous cells. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of cancerous cells is the main obstacle on the way of an effective cancer treatment. However, better comprehension of molecular basis of tumor and the advent of new diagnostic technologies can help to improve the treatment of various cancers. Therefore, study of epigenetic changes, gene expression of cancerous cells and employing methods that enable us to correct or minimize these changes is critically important.

We aimed to determine whether malignant and benign tumors exist in the past societies.Methods:A review of literature using Medline database and Google about benign and malignant tumors in prehistory and antiquity. Only cases with morphological and paraclinical analysis were included. The following keywords were used: cancer; paleopathology; malignant neoplasia; benign tumor; leiomyoma; myoma; breast cancer; mummies; soft tissue tumor; Antiquity.Results:Thirty-five articles were found in wich there were 34 malignant tumors, 10 benign tumors and 11 gynecological benign tumors.Conclusions:The fact that there were some malignant tumors, even few tumors and probably underdiagnosed, in the past may be evidence that cancer is not only a disease of the modern world. Cancer may be indeed a moving target: we have likely predisposing genes to cancer inherited from our ancestors. The malignant disease could therefore appear because of our modern lifestyle (carcinogens and risk factors related to the modern industrial society).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//27839715/,2021

Extensive changes also happen with respect to the metabolism of a cancerous cell encompassing a wide range of functions that include: nutrient acquisition, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and energy generation. These changes are important and some therapeutic approaches for treating cancers have focused on targeting the metabolism of cancerous cells. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have a significant effect on the metabolism of cells. There appears to be a close interaction between metabolism and the signaling pathways in a cancerous cell, in which the interaction provides the metabolic needs of a cancerous cell for uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and metastasis. In this review, we have reviewed the latest findings in this regard and briefly review the most recent research findings regarding targeting the metabolism of cancer cells as a therapeutic approach for treatment of cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//33580511/,2017

Cancerprevention: from 1727 to milestones of the past 100 years.,"Scott M Lippman, Ernest T Hawk, Scott M Lippman, Ernest T Hawk","The rich, multidisciplinary history of cancer prevention recounted here begins with surgical and workplace recommendations of the 1700s and ends with 2009 results of the enormous (35,535 men) Selenium and Vitamin E [prostate] Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). This history comprises a fascinating array of chemopreventive, vaccine, surgical, and behavioral science research, both preclinical and clinical. Preclinical milestones of cancer prevention include the 1913 and 1916 mouse studies by Lathrop and Loeb of cancer development associated with pregnancy or cancer prevention through castration (oophorectomy), preventing chemically induced mouse carcinogenesis as early as 1929, energy restriction studies in the 1940s, the 1950s discoveries and later molecular characterizations of field cancerization and multistep carcinogenesis, and the effects of angiogenesis inhibition in genetically engineered mice reported in 2009. The extraordinary panoply of clinical research includes numerous large and smaller chemoprevention studies of nutritional supplements, other dietary approaches, a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin trial in 1976, molecular-targeted agents, and agents to prevent infection-related cancers such as hepatitis B virus vaccine to prevent liver cancer in 1984. Clinical surgical prevention includes removal of intraepithelial neoplasia detected by screening (including Pap testing developed in 1929 and culposcopy for cervical premalignancy and colonoscopy and polypectomy to prevent colorectal cancer begun in the 1960s) and prophylactic surgeries, such as in Lynch syndrome patients begun in 1977. Behavioral studies include smoking cessation and control beginning in the 1950s, obesity control rooted in studies of 1841, and genetic-counseling and cancer-survivorship studies. This history of pioneering events may help in better understanding who we are and what we want to achieve as cancer prevention researchers and practitioners.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19491253/,2020
Detection ofCancerDNA in Early Stage and Metastatic BreastCancerPatients.,"Arielle J Medford, Riaz N Gillani, Ben Ho Park, Arielle J Medford, Riaz N Gillani, Ben Ho Park","Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. There are many subtypes of breast cancer, which can be identified through the process of molecular and genetic profiling. While the current standard of care utilizes tumor tissue biopsy to subclassify breast cancer, plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) can be detected through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of plasma obtained from a simple blood draw. Tissue biopsy is not only more invasive but because tumors exhibit heterogeneity it can be less accurate. Blood collects DNA shed from normal and cancerous cells alike, thus ddPCR of plasma offers a broader picture of a cancer's genetic makeup. This chapter summarizes how patients with breast cancer can be screened for specific cancerous mutations in both tissue and plasma through the use of ddPCR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//29717446/,2017

It is now well appreciated that high macropinocytic activity is a hallmark of many human tumors, which use this adaptation to scavenge extracellular nutrients for fueling cell growth. In the context of the nutrient-scarce tumor microenvironment, this process provides tumor cells with metabolic flexibility. However, dependence on this scavenging mechanism also illuminates a potential metabolic vulnerability. As such, there is a great deal of interest in understanding the molecular underpinnings of macropinocytosis. In this review, we will discuss the most recent advances in characterizing macropinocytosis: the pathways that regulate it, its contribution to the metabolic fitness of cancer cells, and its therapeutic potential.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//34649835/,2023
Measuring Clonal Evolution inCancerwith Genomics.,"Marc J Williams, Andrea Sottoriva, Trevor A Graham, Marc J Williams, Andrea Sottoriva, Trevor A Graham","Cancers originate from somatic cells in the human body that have accumulated genetic alterations. These mutations modify the phenotype of the cells, allowing them to escape the homeostatic regulation that maintains normal cell number. Viewed through the lens of evolutionary biology, the transformation of normal cells into malignant cells is evolution in action. Evolution continues throughout cancer growth, progression, treatment resistance, and disease relapse, driven by adaptation to changes in the cancer's environment, and intratumor heterogeneity is an inevitable consequence of this evolutionary process. Genomics provides a powerful means to characterize tumor evolution, enabling quantitative measurement of evolving clones across space and time.

Sex differences incancerrisk and outcomes after kidney transplantation.,"Anna Buxeda, Dolores Redondo-Pachón, María José Pérez-Sáez, Marta Crespo, Julio Pascual, Anna Buxeda, Dolores Redondo-Pachón, María José Pérez-Sáez, Marta Crespo, Julio Pascual","Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experience a two- to four-fold increased risk of developing and dying from cancer compared with the general population. High cancer risk results from the interaction of both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. This mapping review explores the impact of sex disparity on cancer's increased incidence and mortality after kidney transplantation (KT). In terms of age, population-based studies indicate that younger recipients of both sexes experience a higher risk of cancer, but this is more pronounced in young women. On the contrary, older men are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, although their increased risk is not statistically significant compared with the general population. Regarding cancer type, studies show an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma, gynecologic and lung cancer in women, and bladder and kidney cancer in men. Immune-related cancers such as pos-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and melanoma are increased in both sexes. Mortality also shows differences between sexes. Although cancer is the second cause of death in both male and female KTRs, studies show higher overall mortality in men and elderly recipients. However, the relative risk of cancer mortality compared with the general population is higher at a younger age, with disparate results regarding sex. Female KTRs appear to die at a younger age than males when compared with the general population. Differences in cancer rates by sex after renal transplantation need further studies. A better understanding of sex-specific differences in cancer epidemiology after KT could help nephrologists to better address pre-transplant counseling, to establish early surveillance programs, and to plan modifiable risk factors such as immunosuppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//34020178/,2016

"Signaling,cancercell plasticity, and intratumor heterogeneity.","Marco Cordani, Ilaria Dando, Giulia Ambrosini, Pedro González-Menéndez, Marco Cordani, Ilaria Dando, Giulia Ambrosini, Pedro González-Menéndez","Cancer's complexity is in part due to the presence of intratumor heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of cancer cell plasticity, which create substantial obstacles in effective cancer management. Variability within a tumor arises from the existence of diverse populations of cancer cells, impacting the progression, spread, and resistance to treatments. At the core of this variability is the concept of cellular plasticity - the intrinsic ability of cancer cells to alter their molecular and cellular identity in reaction to environmental and genetic changes. This adaptability is a cornerstone of cancer's persistence and progression, making it a formidable target for treatments. Emerging studies have emphasized the critical role of such plasticity in fostering tumor diversity, which in turn influences the course of the disease and the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies. The transformative nature of cancer involves a network of signal transduction pathways, notably those that drive the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metabolic remodeling, shaping the evolutionary path of cancer cells. Despite advancements, our understanding of the precise molecular machinations and signaling networks driving these changes is still evolving, underscoring the necessity for further research.

The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a cure eluded us? This chapter will shed light on one of cancer’s most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest known diseases is its ability to change and adapt.

Decoding humancancerwith whole genome sequencing: a review of PCAWG Project studies published in February 2020.,"Simona Giunta, Simona Giunta","Cancer is underlined by genetic changes. In an unprecedented international effort, the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sequenced the tumors of over two thousand five hundred patients across 38 different cancer types, as well as the corresponding healthy tissue, with the aim of identifying genome-wide mutations exclusively found in cancer and uncovering new genetic changes that drive tumor formation. What set this project apart from earlier efforts is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) that enabled to explore alterations beyond the coding DNA, into cancer's non-coding genome. WGS of the entire cohort allowed to tease apart driving mutations that initiate and support carcinogenesis from passenger mutations that do not play an overt role in the disease. At least one causative mutation was found in 95% of all cancers, with many tumors showing an average of 5 driver mutations. The PCAWG Project also assessed the transcriptional output altered in cancer and rebuilt the evolutionary history of each tumor showing that initial driver mutations can occur years if not decades prior to a diagnosis. Here, I provide a concise review of the Pan-Cancer Project papers published on February 2020, along with key computational tools and the digital framework generated as part of the project.

Mean non-RX-OOPE_2YR of cancer patients was similar to that of participants in the matched control group before diagnosis but statistically significantly higher at diagnosis ($1157, P < .001), 2 ($511, P < .001) years, 4 ($360, P = .006) years, and 6 ($430, P = .01) years after diagnosis. A similar pattern was observed in RX-OOPE_MONTHLY. A statistically significantly higher proportion of cancer patients incurred consumer debt at diagnosis (34.5% vs 29.9%; P < .001) and 2 years after (32.5% vs 28.2%; P = .002). There was no statistically significant difference in new IRA withdrawals. Patients experienced lasting financial consequences following cancer diagnosis that were most pronounced among patients aged 65 years and older, in good-to-excellent health at baseline, and with low income, but without Medicaid coverage.Conclusions:Policies to reduce costs and expand insurance coverage options while reducing cost-sharing are needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//35325197/,2020
Cancer'sFuel Choice: New Flavors for a Picky Eater.,"Gina M DeNicola, Lewis C Cantley, Gina M DeNicola, Lewis C Cantley","Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells exhibit a high rate of glycolysis in the presence of ample oxygen, a process termed aerobic glycolysis, in 1924 (Warburg et al., 1924). Since then we have significantly advanced our understanding of cancers' fuel choice to meet their demands for energy and for the production of biosynthetic precursors. In this review, we will discuss the preferred nutrients of cancer cells and how they are utilized to satisfy their bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs. In addition, we will describe how cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as oncogene mutations, nutrient and oxygen availability, and other microenvironmental factors influence fuel choice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//26590711/,2021
Cancerclusters in the USA: what do the last twenty years of state and federal investigations tell us?,"Michael Goodman, Joshua S Naiman, Dina Goodman, Judy S LaKind, Michael Goodman, Joshua S Naiman, Dina Goodman, Judy S LaKind","Background:Cancer clusters garner considerable public and legislative attention, and there is often an expectation that cluster investigations in a community will reveal a causal link to an environmental exposure. At a 1989 national conference on disease clusters, it was reported that cluster studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s rarely, if ever, produced important findings. We seek to answer the question: Have cancer cluster investigations conducted by US health agencies in the past 20 years improved our understanding of cancer etiology, or informed cancer prevention and control?Methods:We reviewed publicly available cancer cluster investigation reports since 1990, obtained from literature searches and by canvassing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Investigations were categorized with respect to cancer type(s), hypothesized exposure, whether perceived clusters were confirmed (e.g. by elevated incidence), and conclusions about a link between cancer(s) of concern and hypothesized environmental exposure(s).Results:We reviewed 428 investigations evaluating 567 cancers of concern. An increase in incidence was confirmed for 72 (13%) cancer categories (including the category ""all sites""). Three of those were linked (with variable degree of certainty) to hypothesized exposures, but only one investigation revealed a clear cause.Conclusions:It is fair to state that extensive efforts to find causes of community cancer clusters have not been successful. There are fundamental shortcomings to our current methods of investigating community cancer clusters. We recommend a multidisciplinary national dialogue on creative, innovative approaches to understanding when and why cancer and other chronic diseases cluster in space and time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22519802/,2017

Predictive biomarker testing is usually carried out on tissue biopsies, which do not represent the entire tumor biology and intratumoral heterogeneity.Objectives:The aim of this study was to explore gastric cancer's intratumoral heterogeneity and its impact on the evaluation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers.Materials and methods:The study cohort consisted of approximately 500 patients with therapy-naive adenocarcinomas of the stomach or the esophagogastric junction. The following biomarkers were determined: HER2, MET, Ki67, PD-L1/PD‑1, VISTA, EBV-status, and PIK3CA.Results:All examined biomarkers were influenced by gastric cancer's intratumoral heterogeneity. Tissue biopsies might carry the risk of sampling errors, which may significantly hamper adequate tumor classification in a clinical setting.Conclusions:Our findings unravel issues of tumor heterogeneity in gastric cancer. Biomarker diagnostics on tissue biopsies should be carried out on at least five biopsies of different tumor areas. If possible, biomarker diagnostics should be repeated on resection specimens.

Findingcancer'sweakest link.,"Nicole M Sodir, Gerard I Evan, Nicole M Sodir, Gerard I Evan","The biological programs of vertebrates exhibit a remarkable degree of functional degeneracy, adaptive compensation and robustness, to preserve homeostasis and generate reproducible phenotypic outputs irrespective of variations in signal strength, noise and quality. Cancers are difficult to treat not only because they are so mechanistically diverse but also because they adapt or evolve in response to any pharmacological elective pressure we impose upon them. Hence, an ideal cancer drug target would exert a function both necessary for cancer cell survival and functionally non-redundant, rendering it impossible for tumor cells to compensate for, or evolve independence from, the inhibitory effect of any drug aimed at that target. In this review, we discuss the unique, non-degenerate and highly pleiotropic role played by Myc in coordinating, engaging and maintaining the diverse intracellular and extracellular programs required for cell proliferation in vivo. These properties make Myc a compelling candidate cancer drug target, at least in principle: an assertion recently reinforced by new in vivo genetic data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22202195/,2017
Cancerin Jews: introduction and overview.,"Henry T Lynch, Wendy S Rubinstein, Gershon Y Locker, Henry T Lynch, Wendy S Rubinstein, Gershon Y Locker","This article is based upon a literature overview of cancer in Jews. It involves a comparison of variation in incidence and prevalence rates between Jews and non-Jews. However, the reader must exercise a certain amount of skepticism when considering secular changes in cancer incidence and prevalence and the public health implications of such cancer variation. Ashkenazi Jews have a lifetime CRC risk of 9--15%. This elevated CRC risk is similar to that of individuals in the ""familial risk'' category, and differs strikingly from the 5-6% CRC risk for non-Ashkenazi members of general Western populations. A MedLine search tested the hypothesis that site-specific and/or all-cancer incidence and mortality rates are either higher or lower than expected in Ashkenazi Jews worldwide, when compared with reference populations. Results showed that all cancer incidence and mortality is not higher in Ashkenazi Jews when compared to North American non-Hispanic whites. Indeed, rates for some cancers, such as carcinoma of the lung in Ashkenazi males, are low; this example is likely attributable in large part to decreased tobacco use. Carcinoma of the ovary, pancreas, stomach, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have a higher incidence rate in Ashkenazi. Even though BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations which predispose to carcinoma of the breast and ovary appear increased in Ashkenazi breast cancer affected women, there was no evidence supporting an elevated risk of breast cancer among Ashkenazi women. Our primary concern, however, is that Ashkenazi Jews may have one of the highest lifetime CRC risks of any ethnic group in the world, a risk that diverges significantly from that of the general population; therein, it logically calls for more intensive CRC screening guidelines. We have emphasized that the reader use caution in the interpretation of statistics which portray variation in incidence and prevalence figures for cancer in any racial, ethnic, or religious group, inclusive, of course, of Jews. Clearly, more research will be required in the interest of accuracy in the understanding of these cancer variations, since they portend the need for special cancer control strategies. A lesser degree of attention can then be given to carcinoma of the penis and uterine cervix, which occur very infrequently in Jews. We urge our colleagues to continue to probe further into these statistical differences in cancer's incidence and prevalence in order to garner a better understanding of cancer's etiology and pathogenesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//15516840/,2016

Autophagy can promote tumor suppression during cancer initiation and protect tumors during progression. Autophagy-associated cell death may act as a tumor suppressor, with several autophagy-related genes deleted in cancers. Loss of autophagy induces genomic instability and necrosis with inflammation in mouse tumor models. Conversely, autophagy enhances survival of tumor cells subjected to metabolic stress and may promote metastasis by enhancing tumor cell survival under environmental stress.

Pathophysiology of lungcancer.,"D D Seale, B M Beaver, D D Seale, B M Beaver","Cigarette smoking is responsible for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths. Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases in men and 75% in women. There are about 38 million former cigarette smokers and about 50 million smokers in the United States today. Smoking rates are higher among blacks, blue collar workers, and less educated people. More than 140,000 lives will be lost to cancer each year because of tobacco smoking. All cancers caused by cigarette smoking could be prevented. It is hoped that public education, smoking cessation programs, and efforts to eliminate carcinogens in the work environment will impact the future incidence of new lung cancer cases. As preventive measures continue, refinement in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer must continue to advance. The recognition of any one of cancer's seven warning signals and prompt subsequent action could lead to earlier detection and a chance for 3- and 5-year survival rates to improve.

"Cancersurvivorship research: state of knowledge, challenges and opportunities.","Noreen M Aziz, Noreen M Aziz","Introduction:Seminal advances in early detection of and treatment strategies for cancer have led to burgeoning numbers of cancer survivors. While most therapeutic modalities for cancer are beneficial and lifesaving, they are associated with adverse long-term and late sequelae.Materials and methods:Literature review using MEDLINE to identify studies examining adverse medical outcomes and post-treatment follow-up care among long-term survivors. Emerging concepts in survivorship research such as definitional issues, research paradigms and methodologic concerns were also examined.Results:Long-term or late adverse sequelae are more prevalent, serious, and persistent than expected in survivors of pediatric and adult cancer, but remain understudied especially among those diagnosed as adults. Follow-up care relevant to survivorship outcomes is neither standardized nor guideline or evidence based for most adult cancers, and optimal practices have yet to be defined.Discussion:Adverse sequelae contribute to burden of illness, health care costs, and decreased length and quality of survival. To-date, very few studies have compared survivor outcomes pre-and post diagnosis. It is critical to examine under-researched questions and understudied survivor groups. Regular follow-up care and monitoring of health status post cancer treatment should 1) permit the timely diagnosis and treatment of adverse outcomes; 2) enable timely diagnosis and treatment of recurrences; 3) facilitate screening and early detection of second cancer(s); 4) allow for detection and management of co-morbidities; and 5) provide the opportunity for preventive strategies such as lifestyle changes. Research findings to-date underscore the need for continued cancer survivorship research that will: inform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adverse sequelae; lead to the design of less toxic treatments; test the effectiveness of interventions - medical, pharmacologic, and behavioral - that reduce adverse outcomes; test models of post-treatment follow-up care; develop an evidence base for optimal follow-up care practices; and inform survivor and provider decision making.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17497308/,2022

Yet, biomedical scientists lack an explicit unifying frame that places this exchange of molecular information at the core of their understanding of cancer as a systemic disease. Propaganda is a type of information that aims at misleading, a form of communication intended primarily to serve the messenger. The biased molecular cross-talk between cancer and non-cancer cells can be considered as a form of biological propaganda.

Evolving Strategies for Therapeutically TargetingCancerStem Cells.,"S Talukdar, L Emdad, S K Das, D Sarkar, P B Fisher, S Talukdar, L Emdad, S K Das, D Sarkar, P B Fisher","Cancer is a multifactor and multistep process that is affected intrinsically by the genetic and epigenetic makeup of tumor cells and extrinsically by the host microenvironment and immune system. A key component of cancer involves a unique subpopulation of highly malignant cancerous cells referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are positioned at the apex of the tumor hierarchy with an ability to both self-renew and also generate non-CSC/differentiated progeny, which contribute to the majority of the tumor mass. CSCs undergo functional changes and show plasticity that is stimulated by specific microenvironmental cues and interactions in the tumor niche, which contribute to the complexity and heterogeneity of the CSC population. The prognostic value of CSCs in the clinic is evident since there are many examples in which CSCs serve as markers for poor patient prognosis. CSCs are innately resistant to many standard therapies and they display anoikis resistance, immune evasion, tumor dormancy, and field cancerization, which may result in metastasis and relapse. Many academic laboratories and biotechnology companies are currently focusing on strategies that target CSCs. Combination therapies, epigenetic modifiers, stemness inhibitors, CSC surface marker-based therapies, and immunotherapy-based CSC-targeting drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials. Potential new targets/strategies in CSC-targeted therapy include MDA-9/Syntenin (SDCBP), Patched (PTCH), epigenetic targets, noncoding RNAs, and differentiation induction.

Signalling architectures can preventcancerevolution.,"Leonardo Oña, Michael Lachmann, Leonardo Oña, Michael Lachmann","Cooperation between cells in multicellular organisms is preserved by an active regulation of growth through the control of cell division. Molecular signals used by cells for tissue growth are usually present during developmental stages, angiogenesis, wound healing and other processes. In this context, the use of molecular signals triggering cell division is a puzzle, because any molecule inducing and aiding growth can be exploited by a cancer cell, disrupting cellular cooperation. A significant difference is that normal cells in a multicellular organism have evolved in competition between high-level organisms to be altruistic, being able to send signals even if it is to their detriment. Conversely, cancer cells evolve their abuse over the cancer's lifespan by out-competing their neighbours. A successful mutation leading to cancer must evolve to be adaptive, enabling a cancer cell to send a signal that results in higher chances to be selected. Using a mathematical model of such molecular signalling mechanism, this paper argues that a signal mechanism would be effective against abuse by cancer if it affects the cell that generates the signal as well as neighbouring cells that would receive a benefit without any cost, resulting in a selective disadvantage for a cancer signalling cell. We find that such molecular signalling mechanisms normally operate in cells as exemplified by growth factors. In scenarios of global and local competition between cells, we calculate how this process affects the fixation probability of a mutant cell generating such a signal, and find that this process can play a key role in limiting the emergence of cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//31959809/,2018

Phytocompounds from the Medicinal and Dietary Plants: Multi-target Agents for CervicalCancerPrevention and Therapy.,"Shoaib Shoaib, Najmul Islam, Nabiha Yusuf, Shoaib Shoaib, Najmul Islam, Nabiha Yusuf","Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Due to cervical cancer's high incidence and mortality, there is an unmet demand for effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive agents. At present, the preferred treatment strategies for advanced metastatic cervical cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, cervical cancer is gradually developing resistance to chemotherapy, thereby reducing its efficacy. Over the last several decades, phytochemicals, a general term for compounds produced from plants, have gained attention for their role in preventing cervical cancer. This role in cervical cancer prevention has garnered attention on the medicinal properties of fruits and vegetables. Phytochemicals are currently being evaluated for their ability to block proteins involved in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance against cervical cancer. Chemoresistance to cancer drugs like cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil has become a significant limitation of drug-based chemotherapy. However, the combination of cisplatin with other phytochemicals has been identified as a promising alternative to subjugate cisplatin resistance. Phytochemicals are promising chemo-preventive and chemotherapeutic agents as they possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative potential against many cancers, including cervical cancer. Furthermore, the ability of the phytochemicals to modulate cellular signaling pathways through up and down regulation of various proteins has been claimed for their therapeutic potential. Phytochemicals also display a wide range of biological functions, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, inhibition of invasion, and migration in cervical cancer cells.

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22608083/,2018

Cancer cells survive by evading these two programs, driven by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. While traditional therapy using small molecular inhibitors and chemotherapy are continuously being utilized, a new and exciting approach is actively underway by identifying and using synergistic relationship between driver and rescue genes in a cancer cell. Through these synthetic lethal relationships, we are gaining tremendous insights into tumor vulnerabilities and specific molecular avenues for induction of programmed cell death.

Is there an increased risk ofcanceramong spouses of patients with an HPV-relatedcancer: A systematic review.,"Haitham Mirghani, Erich M Sturgis, Anne Aupérin, Joseph Monsonego, Pierre Blanchard, Haitham Mirghani, Erich M Sturgis, Anne Aupérin, Joseph Monsonego, Pierre Blanchard","Background:High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) are the cause of most ano-genital cancers and a fast growing subset of oropharyngeal cancer. As these malignancies occur as a result of an HPV- infection transmitted through intimate contact, many patients with HPV- induced cancer and their partners are concerned about HPV-transmission and the potential partners' cancer risk. Few studies have addressed this issue and whether the HPV-related cancer risk of partners of patients with HPV-related cancers is comparable to or greater than that of the general population.Methods:We performed a systematic review of the published literature addressing this issue. Out of 1055 references screened, 53 articles were found eligible for inclusion.Results:Regarding the issue of coincidence of HPV-induced oropharyngeal and/or anogenital cancers in couples, 13 case-reports or case-series were reported and 9 larger studies based on population-registries. Four of these registry studies showed an increased risk of cervical cancer in the partner while four did not. Among the four positive studies, odds ratios for the development of HPV-related cancer among spouses were between 2.6 and 6.7. One study showed an increased risk of tongue or tonsil cancer among husbands of women with cervical dysplasia or cancer. Overall the absolute risk increase in all these studies was small, on the order of 1-3%, although potentially underestimated. Indeed, all these studies have assessed partner's cancer risk at only one anatomical site whereas HPV- related malignancies can affect different locations.Conclusion:This systematic review suggests a small trend of increase risk in HPV-associated cancers among spouses of patients with HPV-related cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28351568/,2017

Canceroutlook: an African perspective.,"A R Walker, A R Walker","In all western populations, mortality rates from cancer are high and even increasing: moreover, incidence rates of some cancers are also rising. As to propitiousness of preventive factors, genetic, gender, and age are beyond alteration: much the same applies to certain protective factors, e.g. late menarche, teenage pregnancy, high parity, long lactation, and greater physical activity. Influential dietary factors, i.e. intakes of energy, fat and fibre, often do not lend themselves to major alteration. Although reductions in smoking have occurred, the practice remains widespread and the intake of alcohol remains high. In developing countries, such as Africa, life-style changes are occurring and the population is incurring all risk factors mentioned. Whereas cancer is relatively uncommon in rural dwellers in developing countries, it is increasing in the huge peri-urban and urban populations due to changes in diet and way of life. Although knowledge should enable us to halve cancer's burden, hopes for meaningful changes are meagre. Survival time can be lengthened by more effective screening, especially of the very susceptible, and by further advances in treatment. Since known risk factors account for only half or less of occurrences of cancer, further rises, or, hopefully, welcome falls, could conceivably occur in the future. We must continue to try to educate the public regarding cancer avoidance: compliance by even a small proportion of those at risk could benefit huge numbers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//7884774/,2016
CYP1B1: A Promising Target inCancerDrug Discovery.,"Marciéli Fabris, Mariana Luiza Silva, Kaio Maciel de Santiago-Silva, Marcelle de Lima Ferreira Bispo, Priscila Goes Camargo, Marciéli Fabris, Mariana Luiza Silva, Kaio Maciel de Santiago-Silva, Marcelle de Lima Ferreira Bispo, Priscila Goes Camargo","CYP1B1 plays an essential role in cancer's pathogenesis since it activates procarcinogens. Significantly, this enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of 17β-estradiol, leading to carcinogenic metabolites involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Therefore, the inhibition of CYP1B1 activity is considered a therapeutic target for chemotherapy. In addition, CYP1B1 is overexpressed in hormone-dependent cancer cells and could be related to resistance to anticancer drugs. However, the activity of CYP1B1 in the tumor microenvironment can metabolize and activate prodrugs in cancer cells, providing more selectivity and being useful for chemoprevention or chemotherapy strategies. Furthermore, due to its importance in anticancer drug design, recent studies have reported using computational methods to understand the intermolecular interactions between possible ligands and CYP1B1. Therefore, in this perspective, we highlight recent findings in developing CYP1B1 inhibitors (flavonoids, trans-stilbenes, estradiol derivatives, and carbazoles) and CYP1B1-activated prodrugs (a chalcone DMU-135 and an oxime DMAKO-20).

The Intratumoral Heterogeneity ofCancerMetabolism.,"Karim Nabi, Anne Le, Karim Nabi, Anne Le","Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, causing over half a million deaths a year in the USA alone. Despite recent advances made in the field of cancer biology and the therapies that have been developed [1, 2], it is clear that more advances are necessary for us to classify cancer as curable. The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a complete cure eluded us? This chapter sheds light on one of cancer's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems.

First, cells must develop the ability to proliferate unchecked. Once this is accomplished, they must be able to invade the neighboring tissue, as well as provide themselves with oxygen and nutrients. Finally, they must acquire the ability to detach from the newly formed mass in order to spread to other tissues, all the while evading an immune system that is primed for their destruction. Furthermore, increased levels of inflammation have been shown to be linked to the development of cancer, with sites of chronic inflammation being a common component of tumorigenic microenvironments. In this Review, we give an overview of the impact of sphingolipid metabolism in cancers, from initiation to metastatic dissemination, as well as discussing immune responses and resistance to treatments.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a key determinant ofcancer'smetabolic phenotype.,"Stefan Rodic, Mark David Vincent, Stefan Rodic, Mark David Vincent","Cancer cells exhibit a wide range of metabolic phenotypes, ranging from strict aerobic glycolysis to increased mitochondrial respiration. The cause and utility of this metabolic variation is poorly understood. Given that cancer cells experience heavy selection within their microenvironment, survival requires metabolic adaptation to both extracellular and intracellular conditions. Herein, we suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a key determinant of cancer's metabolic phenotype. Intracellular ROS levels can be modified by an assortment of critical parameters including oxygenation, glucose availability and growth factors. ROS act as integrators of environmental information as well as downstream effectors of signaling pathways. Maintaining ROS within a narrow range allows malignant cells to enhance growth and invasion while limiting their apoptotic susceptibility. Cancer cells actively modify their metabolism to optimize intracellular ROS levels and thereby improve survival. Furthermore, we highlight distinct metabolic phenotypes in response to oxidative stress and their tumorigenic drivers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28940517/,2017
Treatment options for localized prostatecancer.,"Ravinder Mohan, Paul F Schellhammer, Ravinder Mohan, Paul F Schellhammer","In the United States, more than 90 percent of prostate cancers are detected by serum prostate-specific antigen testing. Most patients are found to have localized prostate cancer, and most of these patients undergo surgery or radiotherapy. However, many patients have low-risk cancer and can follow an active surveillance protocol instead of undergoing invasive treatments. Active surveillance is a new concept in which low-risk patients are closely followed and proceed to intervention only if their cancer progresses. Clinical guidelines can help in selecting between treatment or active surveillance based on the cancer's stage and grade, the patient's prostate-specific antigen level, and the comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy. Radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy is recommended for higher-risk patients. These treatments are almost equivalent in effectiveness, but have different adverse effect profiles. Brachytherapy is an option for low- and moderate-risk patients.

Inflammatory chemokines incancergrowth and progression.,"Barrett J Rollins, Barrett J Rollins","Leukocyte infiltration is a cardinal feature of almost all cancers. Chemokines are generally responsible for eliciting local accumulation of inflammatory cells and they appear to play the same role in the formation of peri- and intra-tumoural infiltrates. Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer formation and progression, and it is likely that the chemokine system contributes to this process. In part, this may be a consequence of its ability to attract mononuclear cells to cancer sites, where they provide growth or angiogenic factors that enhance cancer development. However, accumulating evidence also points to a direct effect of chemokines on cancer cells that express chemokine receptors. In particular, some chemokines can activate anti-apoptotic pathways in these cells. By either mechanism, tumour cells that secrete and/or respond to chemokines would have a selective advantage. This provides another example of cancer's ability to co-opt host systems in order to promote tumour progression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//16510278/,2018
The Metabolism of Renal Cell Carcinomas and LiverCancer.,"Tu Nguyen, Anne Le, Tu Nguyen, Anne Le","According to data from the American Cancer Society, cancer is one of the deadliest health problems globally. Annually, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and liver cancer cause more than 100,000 and 800,000 deaths worldwide, respectively [1–4], creating an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic treatments to increase patient survival outcomes. New therapeutic treatments are expected to address a major factor contributing to cancer’s resistance to standard therapies: oncogenic heterogeneity. Because gene expression can vary tremendously among different types of cancers, different patients of the same tumor type, and even within individual tumors, various metabolic phenotypes can emerge, making single-therapy approaches insufficient. This heterogeneity translates into changes in the landscape of metabolic enzymes and biomolecules within both the cancer cell and tumor microenvironment. Novel strategies targeting the diverse metabolism of cancers aim to overcome this obstacle, and though some have yielded positive results, it remains a challenge to uncover all of the distinct metabolic profiles of RCC and liver cancer. Nonetheless, the metabolic-oriented research focusing on these cancers has offered different, fresh new perspectives, which are expected to contribute heavily to the development of new therapeutic treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//29946779/,2020
Canceris an adaptation that selects in animals against energy dissipation.,"Anthonie W J Muller, Anthonie W J Muller","As cancer usually follows reproduction, it is generally assumed that cancer does not select. Graham has however argued that juvenile cancer, which precedes reproduction, could during evolution have implemented a ""cancer selection"" that resulted in novel traits that suppress this juvenile cancer; an example is protection against UV sunlight-induced cancer, required for the emergence of terrestrial animals from the sea. We modify the cancer selection mechanism to the posited ""cancer adaptation"" mechanism, in which juvenile mortality is enhanced through the diminished care received by juveniles from their (grand) parents when these suffer from cancer in old age. Moreover, it is posited that the cancer adaptation selects against germline ""dissipative genes"", genes that result in enhanced free energy dissipation. Cancer's progression is interpreted as a cascade at increasing scale of repeated amplification of energy dissipation, a cascade involving heat shock, the Warburg effect, the cytokine IL-6, tumours, and hypermetabolism. Disturbance of any physiological process must enhance energy dissipation if the animal remains functioning normally, what explains multicausality, why ""everything gives you cancer"". The hypothesis thus comprises two newly invoked partial processes-diminished (grand) parental care and dissipation amplification-and results in a ""selection against enhanced energy dissipation"" which gives during evolution the benefit of energy conservation. Due to this benefit, cancer would essentially be an adaptation, and not a genetic disease, as assumed in the ""somatic mutation theory"". Cancer by somatic mutations is only a side process. The cancer adaptation hypothesis is substantiated by (1) cancer's extancy, (2) the failure of the somatic mutation theory, (3) cancer's initiation by a high temperature, (4) the interpretation of cancer's progression as a thermal process, and (5) the interpretation of tumours as organs that implement thermogenesis. The hypothesis could in principle be verified by monitoring in a population over several generations (1) the presence of dissipative genes, (2) the incidence of cancer, and (3) the beneficial effect of dissipative gene removal by cancer on starvation/famine survival.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28673566/,2020

In the past, the role of the nervous system in cancer development and progression has largely been ascribed to an immunosuppressive function, which saps the immune system's ability to respond to a tumor. However, it is now clear that direct interactions of tumor cells with nerve cells occur, too. We herein provide arguments for the hypothesis that tumors initiate their own innervation by the release of neurotrophic factors including the nerve growth factor, the brain-derived growth factor, and the vascular endothelial growth factor. By this process, which we have termed neoneurogenesis, the tumor cells get in close contact to the nerve cells, forming a neuro-neoplastic synapse.

"Neoplastic ""Black Ops"":cancer'ssubversive tactics in overcoming host defenses.","Arya Biragyn, Dan L Longo, Arya Biragyn, Dan L Longo","Metastatic cancer is usually an incurable disease. Cancers have a broad repertoire of subversive tactics to defeat the immune system. They mimic self, they down-regulate MHC molecules so that T cells are blind to their presence, they interfere with antigen presentation, and they produce factors that can kill T cells or paralyze their response to antigens. Furthermore, the same powerful machinery designed to prevent harmful autoimmune responses is also acting to protect cancers. In particular, cancer is protected with the help of so-called regulatory immune cells. These unique subsets of cells, represented by almost every immune cell type, function to control responses of effector immune cells. In this review, we will discuss the evidence that cancer actively promotes cross-talk of regulatory immune cells to evade immunosurveillance. We will also discuss the role of a newly described cell type, regulatory B cells, by emphasizing their importance in suppression of antitumor immune responses. Thus, cancer not only directly suppresses immune function, but also recruits components of the immune system to become traitors and protect the tumor from immune attack.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22257681/,2017

Improving the International Agency for Research onCancer'sconsideration of mechanistic evidence.,"Julie Goodman, Heather Lynch, Julie Goodman, Heather Lynch","Background:The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently developed a framework for evaluating mechanistic evidence that includes a list of 10 key characteristics of carcinogens. This framework is useful for identifying and organizing large bodies of literature on carcinogenic mechanisms, but it lacks sufficient guidance for conducting evaluations that fully integrate mechanistic evidence into hazard assessments.Objectives:We summarize the framework, and suggest approaches to strengthen the evaluation of mechanistic evidence using this framework.Discussion:While the framework is useful for organizing mechanistic evidence, its lack of guidance for implementation limits its utility for understanding human carcinogenic potential. Specifically, it does not include explicit guidance for evaluating the biological significance of mechanistic endpoints, inter- and intra-individual variability, or study quality and relevance. It also does not explicitly address how mechanistic evidence should be integrated with other realms of evidence. Because mechanistic evidence is critical to understanding human cancer hazards, we recommend that IARC develop transparent and systematic guidelines for the use of this framework so that mechanistic evidence will be evaluated and integrated in a robust manner, and concurrently with other realms of evidence, to reach a final human cancer hazard conclusion.Conclusions:IARC does not currently provide a standardized approach to evaluating mechanistic evidence. Incorporating the recommendations discussed here will make IARC analyses of mechanistic evidence more transparent, and lead to assessments of cancer hazards that reflect the weight of the scientific evidence and allow for scientifically defensible decision-making.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28162991/,2021
Metabolic modulation ofcancer: a new frontier with great translational potential.,"Adam Kinnaird, Evangelos D Michelakis, Adam Kinnaird, Evangelos D Michelakis","Metabolic oncology is an exciting new field in cancer research, offering a new window to cancer's molecular plasticity and promise for the development of effective, cancer-selective therapies and novel biomarkers. It is based on the realization that cancer's unique metabolism (known since Warburg's report in 1923) with suppression of mitochondrial glucose oxidation and upregulation of cytoplasmic glycolysis is not a secondary but a primary event, offering many growth advantages to cancer cells. Many mechanisms have been revealed, including growth factors, oncogenes, and mutations, all contributing to a suppression of mitochondria, similar to what takes place in hypoxia. This suppression leads to inhibition of mitochondria-driven apoptosis, promotes proliferation, and enhances angiogenesis and metastatic potential. A number of molecular tools and small molecules targeting metabolic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase, have been developed, inhibiting cancer growth in vitro and in vivo in several cancer types. Several have already entered early-phase trials, a great translational success considering the young age of the field (less than 10 years). Here we review the mechanisms and effects of these metabolic modulators and the rationale for further development. This rapidly accumulating knowledge allows some optimism that this may prove to be a paradigm shift in the way we understand and treat cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25586106/,2019

A combined biological and clinical rationale for evaluating metastasis directed therapy in the management of oligometastatic prostatecancer.,"Michael J Kucharczyk, Jonathan So, Gwenaelle Gravis, Christopher Sweeney, Fred Saad, Tamim Niazi, Michael J Kucharczyk, Jonathan So, Gwenaelle Gravis, Christopher Sweeney, Fred Saad, Tamim Niazi","The initial management of potentially oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer has been complicated by rapid advances in the field. Clinically, subgroup analyses of two randomized control trials have suggested that a specific synchronous oligometastatic prostate cancer state may be predictive for benefit from radiation to the primary. Further exploration of metastasis-directed therapy has been supported for various prostate cancer populations among three phase II clinical trials. There are numerous caveats in applying this evidence, a dilemma being addressed by present and upcoming clinical trials. Despite existing clinical equipoise and an avenue to address this uncertainty, the temptation to combine this evidence off-trial exists. Matters have become more complex as our ability to evaluate metastatic disease and tumour biology have also matured. This paper synthesizes our understanding of prostate cancer's natural history into a model which rationalizes both the theoretical benefits and limitations of metastasis directed therapy. We postulate that a metastatic prostate cancer's total disease activity is primarily driven by the combination of its burden of disease and underlying biology, namely genomic instability, then highlight the numerous remaining questions that challenge this hypothesis. This review focuses on harmonizing the language used to describe the disease, the current efforts exploring this hypothesis, and the need for clinical trial participation to appropriately advance patient care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//32858066/,2016
Aneuploid Circulating Tumor-Derived Endothelial Cell (CTEC): A Novel Versatile Player in Tumor Neovascularization andCancerMetastasis.,"Peter Ping Lin, Peter Ping Lin","Hematogenous and lymphogenous cancer metastases are significantly impacted by tumor neovascularization, which predominantly consists of blood vessel-relevant angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, and lymphatic vessel-related lymphangiogenesis. Among the endothelial cells that make up the lining of tumor vasculature, a majority of them are tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs), exhibiting cytogenetic abnormalities of aneuploid chromosomes. Aneuploid TECs are generated from ""cancerization of stromal endothelial cells"" and ""endothelialization of carcinoma cells"" in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Both processes crucially engage the hypoxia-triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Compared to the cancerization process, endothelialization of cancer cells, which comprises the fusion of tumor cells with endothelial cells and transdifferentiation of cancer cells into TECs, is the dominant pathway. Tumor-derived endothelial cells, possessing the dual properties of cancerous malignancy and endothelial vascularization ability, are thus the endothelialized cancer cells. Circulating tumor-derived endothelial cells (CTECs) are TECs shed into the peripheral circulation. Aneuploid CD31+CTECs, together with their counterpart CD31-circulating tumor cells (CTCs), constitute a unique pair of cellular circulating tumor biomarkers. This review discusses a proposed cascaded framework that focuses on the origins of TECs and CTECs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and their clinical implications for tumorigenesis, neovascularization, disease progression, and cancer metastasis. Aneuploid CTECs, harboring hybridized properties of malignancy, vascularization and motility, may serve as a unique target for developing a novel metastasis blockade cancer therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//32599893/,2016
Cellular and molecular mechanisms incancerimmune escape: a comprehensive review.,"Alka Bhatia, Yashwant Kumar, Alka Bhatia, Yashwant Kumar","Immune escape is the final phase of cancer immunoediting process wherein cancer modulates our immune system to escape from being destroyed by it. Many cellular and molecular events govern the cancer's evasion of host immune response. The tumor undergoes continuous remodeling at the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic level to acquire resistance to apoptosis. At the same time, it effectively modifies all the components of the host's immunome so as to escape from its antitumor effects. Moreover, it induces accumulation of suppressive cells like Treg and myeloid derived suppressor cells and factors which also enable it to elude the immune system. Recent research in this area helps in defining the role of newer players like miRNAs and exosomes in immune escape. The immunotherapeutic approaches developed to target the escape phase appear quite promising; however, the quest for a perfect therapeutic agent that can achieve maximum cure with minimal toxicity continues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24325346/,2016

In addition, we critically analyze the appropriateness of current surgical techniques in relation to the concept of field cancerization.

[Cancerprevention by stopping smoking].,"S Tominaga, S Tominaga","Many epidemiological studies have revealed that cigarette smoking is associated with lung cancer and several other cancers and that the risk of lung cancer decreased after smoking cessation. The risk attributable to smoking from cancer can be calculated from the relative risk for smokers and the proportion of smokers in a given population. In Japan 26.7% of cancer of all sites was attributable to smoking among males, whereas only 4.4% was attributable to smoking in females, mainly because of their lower smoking frequency. It was also estimated that if the smoking rate was decreased from the present level of 56.1% to 40% and 20%, 7.7% and 17.2% of cancers of all sites could be prevented in males. The preventable fraction of cancer in females was small (1.4% and 2.9%) even if the smoking rate was decreased from the present level of 14.5% to 10% and 5%. Among males, 65.9% of lung cancer was considered attributable to smoking, and were the smoking rate decreased from the present level of 56.1% to 40% and 20%, up to 18.9% and 42.4% of lung cancer could be prevented. In view of the recent remarkable increase of lung cancer in Japan and the relatively low mortality reducing efficacy of lung cancer screening, it is necessary to promote primary prevention of lung cancer and of other smoking-related cancerous and non-cancerous diseases by extensive smoking control.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//9617314/,2016

Clinical symptoms and comorbidity: significance for the prognostic classification ofcancer.,"J F Piccirillo, A R Feinstein, J F Piccirillo, A R Feinstein","Background:In 1992, the Cancer Registries Amendment Act allotted 30 million dollars annually for five years to establish a national program of cancer registries. Because the cornerstone of cancer staging is the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) system, this article is devoted to a brief history of the system, to important concepts of clinical biology that should be included in classification systems for cancer, and to sources and potential solutions for current problems.Methods:A qualitative review of published literature on cancer staging, prognosis, and treatment effectiveness was performed, notes from previous American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) meetings were reviewed, and a discussion with a former AJCC member was completed.Results:Despite an excellent description of a tumor's size and extent of anatomic spread, the TNM system does not alone account for the cancer's clinical biology which is manifested by both the structural form of a tumor its physiological function in a patient. Important prognostic information can be determined by a patient's symptoms, which reflect some of a tumor's biologic behavior, and by comorbidity that is not a feature of the cancer itself. Five reasons were identified for the adherence to a strictly morphologic staging system.Conclusions:Widespread use of the TNM system during the past 30 years has unquestionably helped to standardize the classification of cancer and to improve prognostic estimates. Nevertheless, the estimates remain relatively imprecise, impairing the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. A prime scientific challenge in current cancer staging is to incorporate the omitted patient-based variables to produce an improved clinical system of classification.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8608472/,2022

CancerNet: a unified deep learning network for pan-cancerdiagnostics.,"Steven Gore, Rajeev K Azad, Steven Gore, Rajeev K Azad","Background:Despite remarkable advances in cancer research, cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of cancer and localization of the tissue of its origin are key to effective treatment. Here, we leverage technological advances in machine learning or artificial intelligence to design a novel framework for cancer diagnostics. Our proposed framework detects cancers and their tissues of origin using a unified model of cancers encompassing 33 cancers represented in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our model exploits the learned features of different cancers reflected in the respective dysregulated epigenomes, which arise early in carcinogenesis and differ remarkably between different cancer types or subtypes, thus holding a great promise in early cancer detection.Results:Our comprehensive assessment of the proposed model on the 33 different tissues of origin demonstrates its ability to detect and classify cancers to a high accuracy (> 99% overall F-measure). Furthermore, our model distinguishes cancers from pre-cancerous lesions to metastatic tumors and discriminates between hypomethylation changes due to age related epigenetic drift and true cancer.Conclusions:Beyond detection of primary cancers, our proposed computational model also robustly detects tissues of origin of secondary cancers, including metastatic cancers, second primary cancers, and cancers of unknown primaries. Our assessment revealed the ability of this model to characterize pre-cancer samples, a significant step forward in early cancer detection. Deployed broadly this model can deliver accurate diagnosis for a greatly expanded target patient population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//35698059/,2016

The few point mutations shared across tumor foci were seldom in cancer-critical genes.Conclusions:In this first large genomic heterogeneity study of primary prostate cancer, we observe that different tumor foci within the same patient are genetically distinct, only rarely sharing any somatic gene mutations, including those in cancer driver genes. This heterogeneity affects how genomics-based management of prostate cancer can be implemented, as information from all tumor foci is necessary to draw valid conclusions about the cancer's genomic alterations.Patient summary:Most primary prostate cancers consist of multiple tumors within the same organ, but little is known about their relationships. We have compared the sets of gene mutations among such tumors and found that they only exceptionally have any in common.

Management of non-melanoma skincancerin immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients.,"Haider K Bangash, Oscar R Colegio, Haider K Bangash, Oscar R Colegio","The management of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs) presents a variety of clinical challenges for physicians. OTRs are at a 65-fold increased risk for developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), the most common NMSC that develops after transplantation. Risk factors contributing to the development of NMSCs in OTRs include a past medical history of any previous skin cancer, a personal history of significant sun exposure and a fair skin complexion or phototype. Further, greater immunosuppressive medication levels lead to an increased risk of NMSCs. Among immunosuppressants, specific older agents such as azathioprine and cyclosporine may increase the risk of developing NMSCs in contrast to newer agents such as sirolimus. Early skin biopsy and treatment of premalignant and malignant lesions are essential for treating these patients successfully. In this regard, the concept of field cancerization has been instructive in broadening treatments to include entire affected areas rather than individual lesions given that the areas with significant ultraviolet irradiation will continue to develop numerous individual precancerous and cancerous lesions. Field therapy with photodynamic therapy or topical 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod or diclofenac is often used in OTRs according to individual patient tolerability. Prompt excision or Mohs micrographic surgery is the standard of care of primary, uncomplicated squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. For patients with in-transit or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas, adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, and staging by sentinel lymph node dissection may be employed. For patients who develop numerous SCC per year, chemoprophylaxis can be effective in limiting the burden of disease. In consultation with the multidisciplinary transplant team, the immunosuppressive regimen can be revised to lower overall immunosuppression or altered to include newer drugs that have decreased oncogenic potential in OTRs. The greatest impact may be made by the prevention of NMSCs through simple, but rigorous, patient education on the benefits of UV protection, periodic self-skin examinations, and regular follow-ups. Accordingly, vitamin D and calcium supplementation should also be incorporated in transplant recipients. Management of OTRs requires patient education, frequent motivation for vigilance, regular follow-up, and interdisciplinary collaboration between transplant surgeons, nephrologists, hepatologists, cardiologists, transplant nurses, dermatologists, oncologists, pharmacists, and other relevant physicians ideally orchestrated by the essential transplant coordinators.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22592596/,2017

Intratumoral microbial components have been discovered in various tumor tissues and are closely linked to the occurrence, progression, and treatment results of cancer. The intratumoral microbiota can enhance antitumor immunity through mechanisms such as activating the stimulator of interferon genes signaling pathway, stimulating T and NK cells, promoting the formation of TLS, and facilitating antigen presentation. Conversely, the intratumoral microbiota might suppress antitumor immune responses by increasing reactive oxygen species levels, creating an anti-inflammatory environment, inducing T cell inactivation, and enhancing immune suppression, thereby promoting cancer progression. The impact of intratumoral microbiota on antitumor immunity varies based on microbial composition, interactions with cancer cells, and the cancer's current state.

The molecular and cellular basis of human lungcancer.,"A F Gazdar, A F Gazdar","Lung cancer arises after a series of morphological changes, which take several years to progress from normal epithelium to invasive cancer. The morphological changes progress from hyperplasia, to metaplasia, to dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, to invasive cancer and finally to metastatic cancer. Multiple molecular changes have been documented in lung cancers, both small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell (NSCLC) types. The number of changes has been estimated to be in double digits. How can so many changes develop in one cell? One possible explanation is the ""field cancerization"" theory, that states that all or much of the aerodigestive tract epithelium has been mutagenized, perhaps as the result of exposure to tobacco products or other carcinogens. The molecular changes include activation of dominant oncogenes (myc family, K-ras and HER/2/neu genes), as well as loss of recessive growth regulatory genes or anti-oncogenes (p53, and rb as well as unidentified gene or genes on chromosome 3). However, cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies indicate that multiple other specific sites of actual or potential DNA loss may be present in lung cancers. Many of the well characterized molecular changes may function as negative prognostic factors for survival in subsets of lung cancers. Other changes may include development of drug resistance, and production of growth factors and their receptors. It is tempting to associate specific molecular changes with specific morphological changes, as has been attempted in the colon. However, because of the difficulties in serially sampling the respiratory tract, only a modest amount of data has been collected to date. It appears that deletions of chromosome 3p, hyperproliferation and aneuploidy are early changes, while p53 mutations appear later in the preneoplastic cascade. Documentation of intermediate markers for lung cancer and prospective studies of their prognostic effects will be necessary for the design of rational chemoprevention trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8166465/,2016

Fieldcancerizationin mammary carcinogenesis - Implications for prevention and treatment of breastcancer.,"Ashley G Rivenbark, William B Coleman, Ashley G Rivenbark, William B Coleman","The natural history of breast cancer unfolds with the development of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in normal breast tissue, and evolution of this pre-invasive neoplasm into invasive cancer. The mechanisms that drive these processes are poorly understood, but evidence from the literature suggests that mammary carcinogenesis may occur through the process of field cancerization. Clinical observations are consistent with the idea that (i) DCIS may arise in a field of altered breast epithelium, (ii) narrow surgical margins do not remove the entire altered field (contributing to recurrence and/or disease progression), and (iii) whole-breast radiation therapy is effective in elimination of the residual field of altered cells adjacent to the resected DCIS. Molecular studies suggest that the field of altered breast epithelial cells may carry cancer-promoting genetic mutations (or other molecular alterations) or cancer promoting epimutations (oncogenic alterations in the epigenome). In fact, most breast cancers develop through a succession of molecular events involving both genetic mutations and epimutations. Hence, in hereditary forms of breast cancer, the altered field reflects the entire breast tissue which is composed of cells with a predisposing molecular lesion (such as a BRCA1 mutation). In the example of a BRCA1-mutant patient, it is evident that local resection of a DCIS lesion or localized but invasive cancer will not result in elimination of the altered field. In sporadic breast cancer patients, the mechanistic basis for the altered field may not be so easily recognized. Nonetheless, identification of the nature of field cancerization in a given patient may guide clinical intervention. Thus, patients with DCIS that develops in response to an epigenetic lesion (such as a hypermethylation defect affecting the expression of tumor suppressor genes) might be treated with epigenetic therapy to normalize the altered field and reduce the risk of secondary occurrence of DCIS or progression to invasive cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//23142414/,2020
Forkhead box-O transcription factor: critical conductors ofcancer'sfate.,"Carl Weidinger, Kerstin Krause, Antje Klagge, Stefan Karger, Dagmar Fuhrer, Carl Weidinger, Kerstin Krause, Antje Klagge, Stefan Karger, Dagmar Fuhrer","Cells have evolved elaborated mechanisms to coordinate the cellular answer of either survival or apoptosis. Recent concepts of human carcinogenesis have suggested disturbances in these cellular relays as a potential link to cellular dedifferentiation and uncontrolled proliferation. Forkhead box-O transcription factors (FOXOs) play an important role in tumour suppression by regulating the expression of genes involved in stress resistance, DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The specific regulation of FOXO function is tightly controlled by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Loss of FOXO function has recently been identified in several human cancers. In this review, we will give an overview about recent progress in the understanding of function and regulation of FOXOs, as well as their role in carcinogenesis.

Mapping cutaneous field carcinogenesis of nonmelanoma skincancerusing mesoscopic imaging of pro-inflammation cues.,"Andrea L Shugar, Raymond L Konger, Craig A Rohan, Jeffrey B Travers, Young L Kim, Andrea L Shugar, Raymond L Konger, Craig A Rohan, Jeffrey B Travers, Young L Kim","Nonmelanoma skin cancers remain the most widely diagnosed types of cancers globally. Thus, for optimal patient management, it has become imperative that we focus our efforts on the detection and monitoring of cutaneous field carcinogenesis. The concept of field cancerization (or field carcinogenesis), introduced by Slaughter in 1953 in the context of oral cancer, suggests that invasive cancer may emerge from a molecularly and genetically altered field affecting a substantial area of underlying tissue including the skin. A carcinogenic field alteration, present in precancerous tissue over a relatively large area, is not easily detected by routine visualization. Conventional dermoscopy and microscopy imaging are often limited in assessing the entire carcinogenic landscape. Recent efforts have suggested the use of noninvasive mesoscopic (between microscopic and macroscopic) optical imaging methods that can detect chronic inflammatory features to identify pre-cancerous and cancerous angiogenic changes in tissue microenvironments. This concise review covers major types of mesoscopic optical imaging modalities capable of assessing pro-inflammatory cues by quantifying blood haemoglobin parameters and hemodynamics. Importantly, these imaging modalities demonstrate the ability to detect angiogenesis and inflammation associated with actinically damaged skin. Representative experimental preclinical and human clinical studies using these imaging methods provide biological and clinical relevance to cutaneous field carcinogenesis in altered tissue microenvironments in the apparently normal epidermis and dermis. Overall, mesoscopic optical imaging modalities assessing chronic inflammatory hyperemia can enhance the understanding of cutaneous field carcinogenesis, offer a window of intervention and monitoring for actinic keratoses and nonmelanoma skin cancers and maximise currently available treatment options.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//38610095/,2017

Stem cells and lungcancer: future therapeutic targets?,"Malcolm R Alison, Arielle C Lebrenne, Shahriar Islam, Malcolm R Alison, Arielle C Lebrenne, Shahriar Islam","In both the UK and USA more people die of lung cancer than any other type of cancer. Lung cancer's high mortality rate is also reflected on a global scale, with lung cancer accounting for more than 1 million deaths per year. In tissues with ordered structure such a lung epithelia, it is likely that the cancers have their origins in normal adult stem cells, and then the tumours themselves are maintained by a population of malignant stem cells - so-called cancer stem cells. This review examines both these postulates in animal models and in the clinical setting, noting that stem cell niches appear to foster tumour development, and that drug resistance can often be attributed to malignant cells with stem cell properties.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19653862/,2018

Evolution of Premalignant Disease.,"Kit Curtius, Nicholas A Wright, Trevor A Graham, Kit Curtius, Nicholas A Wright, Trevor A Graham","Where does cancer come from? Although the cell-of-origin is difficult to pinpoint, cancer clones harbor information about their clonal ancestries. In an effort to find cells before they evolve into a life-threatening cancer, physicians currently diagnose premalignant diseases at frequencies that substantially exceed those of clinical cancers. Cancer risk prediction relies on our ability to distinguish between which premalignant features will lead to cancer mortality and which are characteristic of inconsequential disease. Here, we review the evolution of cancer from premalignant disease, and discuss the concept that even phenotypically normal cell progenies inherently gain more malignant potential with age. We describe the hurdles of prognosticating cancer risk in premalignant disease by making reference to the underlying continuous and multivariate natures of genotypes and phenotypes and the particular challenge inherent in defining a cell lineage as ""cancerized.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28490542/,2021
Cancer'simpact on employment and earnings--a population-based study from Norway.,"Astri Syse, Steinar Tretli, Øystein Kravdal, Astri Syse, Steinar Tretli, Øystein Kravdal","Introduction:Increased attention is being paid to the long-term health and well-being of people living with a history of cancer. Of particular concern is cancer's effect on productivity and work ability, which in turn is important for persons' financial situation, life satisfaction, and social relationships. We explored the extent to which Norwegian cancer survivors stay affiliated to working life compared to the cancer-free population, and quantified cancer-associated earning declines.Methods and results:Logistic regression models were estimated to explore the impact of cancer on employment using register data covering the entire Norwegian population in 2001, 567,000 men and 549,300 women 40-59 years old, of whom 34,000 were diagnosed with cancer. These analyses revealed that a cancer diagnosis was strongly associated with not being employed. Log-linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of cancer on labor earnings in 2001 for those employed. Cancer was associated with a 12% decline in earnings overall. Leukemia, lymphomas, lung, brain, bone, colorectal, and head-and-neck cancer resulted in the largest reductions in employment and earnings. Earning declines were strongly associated with educational level. In addition, linear regression models were used to estimate differentials in earnings before and after cancer. These results accorded well with those from cross-sectional models.Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors:Cancer survivors are less likely to be employed than the cancer-free population, and undertake modifications in their employment, e.g. reduce work-hours or hold lower-wage jobs, which result in reduced earnings. A social class gradient is present and must be addressed to accommodate appropriate intervention from welfare societies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//18792789/,2020

"[Prevention of cervicalcancer(II): prophylactic HPV vaccination, current knowledge, practical procedures and new issues].","Joseph Monsonego, Joseph Monsonego","Despite the considerable success of early screening for prevention of cervical cancer, Pap smears have not fulfilled the hopes that it would lead to a large-scale reduction of this cancer's incidence. Screening appears to be useful for a tiny portion of the world population, although a relatively large portion must put up with its limitations and disadvantages. Human papilloma viruses (HPV) 16 and 18 are responsible for two thirds of all cervical cancers worldwide. The condylomata (condyloma acuminatum), or genital warts, induced by HPV 6 and 11 are frequent among the young and difficult to manage. The extent and burden of HPV infection are considerable, as is the psychological and emotional impact of the diseases associated with it. Because cancer of the cervix is the final consequence of chronic HPV infection, it can be prevented by vaccination. A prophylactic vaccine to protect against the precancerous and cancerous lesions associated with HPV should save lives, reduce expensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and have substantial individual and collective benefits. Clinical trials of anti-HPV vaccines for the prevention of cervical cancer and condyloma have shown remarkable results and an efficacy unequaled in the history of vaccination against infectious diseases. Vaccine efficacy has been shown only in young girls never exposed to the virus and only for the lesions associated with the specific viral types in the vaccine. Preliminary data indicate that the vaccination is effective in women who have previously eliminated naturally the virus. It has no therapeutic effects on existing lesions or in healthy virus carriers. Practical questions remain to be resolved. If the vaccination is left to individual initiative and vaccination coverage is insufficient, there will be no perceptible reduction in the frequency of cervical cancer. Vaccination policies will not be identical in poor countries, where the disease represents one of the leading causes of mortality among women, and in the rich countries, where screening programs have considerably reduced the frequency of this cancer. Current planning calls for the introduction of systematic vaccination of young girls aged 9-15 years, with progressive ""catch-up"" vaccination of the cohorts of young women aged 16-26 years. Nonetheless mathematical models and immunogenicity results indicate a possible benefit for individual vaccination of adults. This approach must still be assessed in the clinical trials underway. Because the vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV associated with cervical cancer, screening must be continued according to the conditions currently set. Vaccination and screening, which are complementary and synergistic, now constitute the new standards for prevention of this disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17350792/,2018

This study was carried out to examine the status of cancer patient education in Iran. Using the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer's (MASCC) patient education questionnaire, 310 individuals - a sample of heterogeneous cancer patients ( n=167) and their relatives ( n=143) - were enrolled in the study. The pooled results indicated that only 15% of respondents believed more than 80% of cancer patients were told of their diagnosis. In contrast, 30% of respondents thought less than 20% of patients knew their cancer diagnosis. When asked, ""Were you given written materials about (i) cancer, (ii) treatment, and (iii) symptom management"", the vast majority of respondents said ""No"" (91%, 87%, and 87%, respectively). When respondents were asked, ""Would you like to learn more about cancer and treatments"", 97% said ""Yes"". Most respondents indicated the need for information on the treatments available (27%) and general information about cancer (20%); most had sought information from health professionals (31%), other cancer patients and friends (29%), and television (22%). Finally, it was found that concern about patients' depression (17%), lack of printed materials (13%), the idea that it was better for patients not to know (12%), and families' requests not to tell the patient (11%) were the most frequently stated barriers to or reasons for restricted cancer patient education. The findings of the study suggest that cancer patient education in Iran is very poor and there is an urgent need to develop policy guidelines on disclosure of cancer diagnoses and patient education.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//11862507/,2017
Targetingcancer'sweaknesses (not its strengths): Therapeutic strategies suggested by the atavistic model.,"Charles H Lineweaver, Paul C W Davies, Mark D Vincent, Charles H Lineweaver, Paul C W Davies, Mark D Vincent","In the atavistic model of cancer progression, tumor cell dedifferentiation is interpreted as a reversion to phylogenetically earlier capabilities. The more recently evolved capabilities are compromised first during cancer progression. This suggests a therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer: design challenges to cancer that can only be met by the recently evolved capabilities no longer functional in cancer cells. We describe several examples of this target-the-weakness strategy. Our most detailed example involves the immune system. The absence of adaptive immunity in immunosuppressed tumor environments is an irreversible weakness of cancer that can be exploited by creating a challenge that only the presence of adaptive immunity can meet. This leaves tumor cells more vulnerable than healthy tissue to pathogenic attack. Such a target-the-weakness therapeutic strategy has broad applications, and contrasts with current therapies that target the main strength of cancer: cell proliferation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25043755/,2018
Generalizing Few-Shot Classification of Whole-Genome Doubling AcrossCancerTypes.,"Sherry Chao, David Belanger, Sherry Chao, David Belanger","The study and treatment of cancer is traditionally specialized to the cancer's site of origin. However, certain phenotypes are shared across cancer types and have important implications for clinical care. To date, automating the identification of these characteristics from routine clinical data - irrespective of the type of cancer - is impaired by tissue-specific variability and limited labeled data. Whole-genome doubling is one such phenotype; whole-genome doubling events occur in nearly every type of cancer and have significant prognostic implications. Using digitized histopathology slide images of primary tumor biopsies, we train a deep neural network end-to-end to accurately generalize few-shot classification of whole-genome doubling across 17 cancer types. By taking a meta-learning approach, cancer types are treated as separate but jointly-learned tasks. This approach outperforms a traditional neural network classifier and quickly generalizes to both held-out cancer types and batch effects. These results demonstrate the unrealized potential for meta-learning to not only account for between-cancer type variability but also remedy technical variability, enabling real-time identification of cancer phenotypes that are too often costly and inefficient to obtain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//34890144/,2017
Deciphering the molecular mechanism of thecancerformation by chromosome structural dynamics.,"Xiakun Chu, Jin Wang, Xiakun Chu, Jin Wang","Cancer reflects the dysregulation of the underlying gene network, which is strongly related to the 3D genome organization. Numerous efforts have been spent on experimental characterizations of the structural alterations in cancer genomes. However, there is still a lack of genomic structural-level understanding of the temporal dynamics for cancer initiation and progression. Here, we use a landscape-switching model to investigate the chromosome structural transition during the cancerization and reversion processes. We find that the chromosome undergoes a non-monotonic structural shape-changing pathway with initial expansion followed by compaction during both of these processes. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the chromosome with a more expanding structure than those at both the normal and cancer cell during cancerization exhibits a sparse contact pattern, which shows significant structural similarity to the one at the embryonic stem cell in many aspects, including the trend of contact probability declining with the genomic distance, the global structural shape geometry and the spatial distribution of loci on the chromosome. In light of the intimate structure-function relationship at the chromosomal level, we further describe the cell state transition processes by the chromosome structural changes, suggesting an elevated cell stemness during the formation of the cancer cells. We show that cell cancerization and reversion are highly irreversible processes in terms of the chromosome structural transition pathways, spatial repositioning of chromosomal loci and hysteresis loop of contact evolution analysis. Our model draws a molecular-scale picture of cell cancerization from the chromosome structural perspective. The process contains initial reprogramming towards the stem cell followed by the differentiation towards the cancer cell, accompanied by an initial increase and subsequent decrease of the cell stemness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//34752443/,2022

To provide guidance to nurses working with breast cancer survivors, a focused review of the literature exploring the symptomatology and prevalence of breast cancer's late effects as well as the use of CAM therapies to improve those effects is presented. Evidence suggests that CAM therapies have sometimes been incorporated into symptom management strategies currently employed; however, the evidential claims as a whole have been generally inconclusive, especially for complete resolution of the late effects.

Strategies for stalling malignancy: targetingcancer'saddiction to Hsp90.,"Chrisostomos Prodromou, Chrisostomos Prodromou","Hsp90 is involved in the maturation and activation of client proteins. Often these are key proteins involved in signal transduction and regulatory pathways that in a mutated and/or deregulated form sustain an oncogenic cellular state. Consequently, the malignancy is maintained with the aid of Hsp90 upon which the mutated proteins have become particularly dependent for their activity. The requirement for the Hsp90 chaperone machine to drive the malignancy makes Hsp90 a prime anticancer target, an 'axle in a wheel' that when disrupted has been shown to be effective in killing cancerous cells. This review aims to identify potential drug targets, based on the current structural knowledge of the Hsp90-chaperone machine, that could be targeted with the aim of disrupting its functioning and promoting an anti-cancer activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19860736/,2018

Epistemology of the origin ofcancer: a new paradigm.,"Björn Ldm Brücher, Ijaz S Jamall, Björn Ldm Brücher, Ijaz S Jamall","Background:Carcinogenesis is widely thought to originate from somatic mutations and an inhibition of growth suppressors, followed by cell proliferation, tissue invasion, and risk of metastasis. Fewer than 10% of all cancers are hereditary; the ratio in gastric (1%), colorectal (3-5%) and breast (8%) cancers is even less. Cancers caused by infection are thought to constitute some 15% of the non-hereditary cancers. Those remaining, 70 to 80%, are called ""sporadic,"" because they are essentially of unknown etiology. We propose a new paradigm for the origin of the majority of cancers.Presentation of hypothesis:Our paradigm postulates that cancer originates following a sequence of events that include (1) a pathogenic stimulus (biological or chemical) followed by (2) chronic inflammation, from which develops (3) fibrosis with associated changes in the cellular microenvironment. From these changes a (4) pre-cancerous niche develops, which triggers the deployment of (5) a chronic stress escape strategy, and when this fails to resolve, (6) a transition of a normal cell to a cancer cell occurs. If we are correct, this paradigm would suggest that the majority of the findings in cancer genetics so far reported are either late events or are epiphenomena that occur after the appearance of the pre-cancerous niche.Testing the hypothesis:If, based on experimental and clinical findings presented here, this hypothesis is plausible, then the majority of findings in the genetics of cancer so far reported in the literature are late events or epiphenomena that could have occurred after the development of a PCN. Our model would make clear the need to establish preventive measures long before a cancer becomes clinically apparent. Future research should focus on the intermediate steps of our proposed sequence of events, which will enhance our understanding of the nature of carcinogenesis. Findings on inflammation and fibrosis would be given their warranted importance, with research in anticancer therapies focusing on suppressing the PCN state with very early intervention to detect and quantify any subclinical inflammatory change and to treat all levels of chronic inflammation and prevent fibrotic changes, and so avoid the transition from a normal cell to a cancer cell.Implication of the hypothesis:The paradigm proposed here, if proven, spells out a sequence of steps, one or more of which could be interdicted or modulated early in carcinogenesis to prevent or, at a minimum, slow down the progression of many cancers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24885752/,2019

An Entropy-Based Method for Identifying Mutual Exclusive Driver Genes inCancer.,"Junrong Song, Wei Peng, Feng Wang, Junrong Song, Wei Peng, Feng Wang","Cancer in essence is a complex genomic alteration disease which is caused by the somatic mutations during the lifetime. According to previous researches, the first step to overcome cancer is to identify driver genes which can promote carcinogenesis. However, it is still a big challenge to precisely and efficiently extract the cancer related driver genes because the nature of cancer is heterogeneous and there exists tremendously irrelevant passenger mutations which have no function impact on the cancer's development. In this work, we proposed a novel entropy-based method namely EntroRank to identify driver genes by integrating the subcellular localization information and mutual exclusive of variation frequency into the network. EntroRank can take into full consideration different properties of driver genes. Considering the modularity of driver genes, the mutated genes in the network were first clustered into different subgroups according to their located compartments. After that, the structural entropy of the gene in the subgroup was employed to measure its indispensability. Considering mutual exclusive property between driver genes in the modules, relative entropy was utilized to measure the degree of mutual exclusive between two mutated genes in terms of their variation frequency. We applied our method to three different cancers including lung, prostate, and breast cancer. The results show our method not only detect the well-known important drivers but also prioritiz the rare unknown driver genes. Besides, EntroRank can identify driver genes having mutual exclusive property. Compared with other existing methods, our method achieves a better performance for most of cancer types in terms of Precision, Recall, and Fscore.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//30763245/,2021

Doescanceraffect marriage rates?,"Astri Syse, Astri Syse","Introduction:Finding a life partner is of great importance for persons' life satisfaction, but cancer's potential impact on family life is not well described. Cancer's impact on marriage formation rates was therefore explored.Method:Data on the entire unmarried Norwegian population aged 17-44 in 1974-2001 (N = 2.2 million) come from the Cancer Registry and the Central Population Register. Marriage rates for 12,100 persons diagnosed with cancer were compared to marriage rates for otherwise similar persons using discrete-time hazard regression models.Results:Men with cancer had a marriage probability that was five percent higher (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.11) than cancer-free men. No cancer forms reduced men's marriage rates, and significantly elevated rates were seen after skin and testicular cancer (OR 1.16 and 1.11). Cancer did not impact significantly on women's overall marriage rate (OR 0.95, CI 0.90-1.00), but pronounced deficiencies were seen after brain and breast cancer (OR 0.62 and 0.74). Skin cancer elevated women's marriage rate (OR 1.27). Male cancer survivors with children were more likely to marry than their female counterparts. Significant increases in cancer survivors' marriage rates were observed over time.Conclusion:Marrying after cancer is more common today than previously, and only slight overall differences were observed in cancer survivors' marriage rates relative to those of the cancer-free population. However, while brain and breast cancer in women is associated with reduced marriage rates, testicular cancer is associated with increased rates. The differences observed between common cancer forms in young adults deserve further exploration.Implications for cancer survivors:In general, marriage rates in survivors of most types of cancer are very similar to those in the population as a whole. Women with brain and breast cancer have lower marriage rates than their cancer-free counterparts. While it is necessary to identify exactly why this was observed, the information can alert those with these cancers to the potential impact on marriage and thus work to reduce the possible effect, if desired.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//18663582/,2022

Bladdercancerextracellular vesicles drive tumorigenesis by inducing the unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum of nonmalignant cells.,"Chia-Hao Wu, Christopher R Silvers, Edward M Messing, Yi-Fen Lee, Chia-Hao Wu, Christopher R Silvers, Edward M Messing, Yi-Fen Lee","The field cancerization effect has been proposed to explain bladder cancer's multifocal and recurrent nature, yet the mechanisms of this effect remain unknown. In this work, using cell biology, flow cytometry, and qPCR analyses, along with a xenograft mouse tumor model, we show that chronic exposure to tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) results in the neoplastic transformation of nonmalignant human SV-HUC urothelial cells. Inhibition of EV uptake prevented this transformation. Transformed cells not only possessed several oncogenic properties, such as increased genome instability, loss of cell-cell contact inhibition, and invasiveness, but also displayed altered morphology and cell structures, such as an enlarged cytoplasm with disrupted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alignment and the accumulation of smaller mitochondria. Exposure of SV-HUC cells to TEVs provoked the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER). Prolonged induction of UPRERsignaling activated the survival branch of the UPRERpathway, in which cells had elevated expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), NF-κB, and the inflammatory cytokine leptin, and incurred loss of the pro-apoptotic protein C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). More importantly, inhibition of ER stress by docosahexaenoic acid prevented TEV-induced transformation. We propose that TEVs promote malignant transformation of predisposed cells by inhibiting pro-apoptotic signals and activating tumor-promoting ER stress-induced unfolded protein response and inflammation. This study provides detailed insight into the mechanisms underlying the bladder cancer field effect and tumor recurrence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//30593508/,2020

Importantly, epigenetic alterations are reversible and can be targets for therapy or chemoprevention for various types of human cancers. A field for cancerization, or a field defect, is formed by the accumulation of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations in normal-appearing tissues and can correlate with risk of cancer development. Thus, a better understanding of epigenetic field cancerization may represent a useful translational opportunity for cancer risk assessment, including previous history and exposure to carcinogenic factors, and for cancer prevention.

Galen (130-201 AD), sustained that melancholy could give rise to a tumour and his theory was repeated by the Byzantine and Arab physicians. In the 19th century, malignancy and depression became synonymous and people attributed their cancer to sadness. In 1893, the London surgeon Hebert Snow (1847-1930), performed an epidemiological study in order to clarify that link. The results revealed a probable connection. His work was followed by several large scale prospective studies some of which identified depression as a risk factor for cancer where others found no association.

It is widely believed that by understanding the driving forces underlying cancer, researchers can develop better ways to target the disease. Currently, large-scale efforts have been under taken to completely characterize molecular changes in common human cancers (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) (Collins & Barker, 2007). However, as more is learned about cancer, the debate increases on what exactly the enemy is: cells making up the bulk of the tumour, rare tumour stem cells that can regrow the tumour, tumour microenvironment, the subset of cancer cells with metastatic potential, etc. Studies of the cancers associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are helping to define the relationship between many of these different cell types. It is still unclear how these different enemies are related to each other and how they interact to wage cancer's war on the patient.

An evolutionary perspective on fieldcancerization.,"Kit Curtius, Nicholas A Wright, Trevor A Graham, Kit Curtius, Nicholas A Wright, Trevor A Graham","Tumorigenesis begins long before the growth of a clinically detectable lesion and, indeed, even before any of the usual morphological correlates of pre-malignancy are recognizable. Field cancerization, which is the replacement of the normal cell population by a cancer-primed cell population that may show no morphological change, is now recognized to underlie the development of many types of cancer, including the common carcinomas of the lung, colon, skin, prostate and bladder. Field cancerization is the consequence of the evolution of somatic cells in the body that results in cells that carry some but not all phenotypes required for malignancy. Here, we review the evidence of field cancerization across organs and examine the biological mechanisms that drive the evolutionary process that results in field creation. We discuss the clinical implications, principally, how measurements of the cancerized field could improve cancer risk prediction in patients with pre-malignant disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//29217838/,2017

Pathological diagnosis of surgical margins is sometimes unreliable due to tissue shrinkage, invisible field cancerization and skipped lesions like tumor budding. As a result, tumor recurrences sometimes occur even from the pathologically negative surgical margins.Methods:We applied molecular surgical margin (MSM) analysis by tissue imprinting procedure to improve the detection sensitivity of tiny cancerous cells on the surgical specimen surface after pancreatoduodenectomy. Surgical specimens were collected from 45 pancreatic cancer cases who received subtotal stomach preserving pancreatoduodenectomy at Nagoya University Hospital during 2017-2019. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) of the original methylation marker panel (CD1D, KCNK12, PAX5) were performed and analyzed with postoperative survival outcomes.Results:Among 45 tumors, 26 cases (58%) were QMSP-positive for CD1D, 25 (56%) for KCNK12 and 27 (60%) for PAX5. Among the 38 tumors in which at least one of the three markers was positive, CD1D-positive cancer cells, KCNK12-positive cancer cells, and PAX5-positive cancer cells were detected at the surgical margin in 8 cases, 7 cases and 10 cases, respectively. Consequently, a total of 17 patients had at least one marker detected at the surgical margin by QMSP, and these patients were defined as MSM-positive. They were associated with significantly poor recurrence-free survival (p = 0.002) and overall survival (p = 0.005) than MSM-negative patients. Multivariable analysis showed that MSM-positive was the only significant independent factor for worse recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 3.522, 95% confidence interval: 1.352-9.179, p = 0.010). On the other hand, a significant proportion of MSM-negative cases were found to have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.019).Conclusion:Pancreatic cancer-specific methylation marker panel was established to perform MSM analysis. MSM-positive status might represent microscopically undetectable cancer cells on the surgical margin and might influence the postoperative long-term outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//34530906/,2018

Tumor Hypoxia and Circulating Tumor Cells.,"Walter Tinganelli, Marco Durante, Walter Tinganelli, Marco Durante","Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a rare tumor cell subpopulation induced and selected by the tumor microenvironment's extreme conditions. Under hypoxia and starvation, these aggressive and invasive cells are able to invade the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Escaping from the primary tumor, CTCs enter into the bloodstream to form metastatic deposits or re-establish themselves in cancer's primary site. Although radiotherapy is widely used to cure solid malignancies, it can promote metastasis. Radiation can disrupt the primary tumor vasculature, increasing the dissemination of CTCs. Radiation also induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and eliminates suppressive signaling, causing the proliferation of existent, but previously dormant, disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). In this review, we collect the results and evidence underlying the molecular mechanisms of CTCs and DTCs and the effects of radiation and hypoxia in developing these cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//33339353/,2023

Due to Field-Effect phenomena (also called field cancerization), the adjacent cavity side area of the margin is histologically normal, but it has been entered into neoplastic transformation due to MCT4 and MCT1 pathways activated by H2O2/ROS oxidative stress agents secreted by CAF in adjacent tumor bed microenvironment. This paper specifically focused on the role of cancer-associated fibroblast in breast tumor beds and its correlation with the presence of scattered cancer cells or onco-protein-activated cells (may be high risk but not completely transformed cancer cells) in the cavity side margins.Methods:In this study, the glycolytic behavior of non-tumoral cavity side margins was examined using carbon nanotube-based electrochemical biosensors integrated into a cancer diagnostic probe. This method enabled the detection of CAF accumulation sites in non-cancerous neighboring tissues of tumors, with a correlation to CAF concentration. Subsequently, RT-PCR, fluorescent, histopathological, and invasion assays were conducted on hyperglycolytic lesions to explore any correlation between the abundance of CAFs and the electrochemical responses of the non-cancerous tissues surrounding the tumor, as well as their neoplastic potential.Results:We observed overexpression of cancer-associated transcriptomes as well as the presence and hyperactivation of CAFs in cavity-side regions in which glycolytic metabolism was recorded, independent of the histopathological state of the lesion. At mean 70.4%, 66.7%, 70.4%, and 44.5% increments were observed in GLUT-1, MMP-2, N-cadherin, and MMP-9 transcriptomes by highly glycolytic but histologically cancer-free expression samples in comparison with negative controls (histologically non-cancer lesions with low glycolytic behavior).Conclusion:The presence of CAFs is correlated with the presence of high glycolytic metabolism in the cavity margin lesion, high ROS level in the lesion, and finally aggressive cancer-associated proteins (such as MMP2, …) in the margin while these metabolomes, molecules, and proteins are absent in the margins with negatively scored CDP response and low ROS level. So, it seems that when we observe CAFs in glycolytic lesions with high ROS levels, some high-risk epithelial breast cells may exist while no histological trace of cancer cells was observed. Further research on CAFs could provide valuable insights into the local recurrence of malignant breast diseases. Hence, real-time sensors can be used to detect and investigate CAFs in the non-tumoral regions surrounding tumors in cancer patients, potentially aiding in the prevention of cancer recurrence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//39287633/,2016

However, single or dual CMPs cannot always successfully distinguish every kind of malignant cell from its benign counterpart. In this work, we extract 4 CMPs of four different graded bladder cancer (BC) cell lines by AFM (atomic force microscopy)-based nanoindentation to generate a CMP database, which is used to train a cancerization-grade classifier by machine learning. The classifier is tested on 4 categories of BC cells at different cancer grades. The classification shows split-independent robustness and an accuracy of 91.25% with an AUC-ROC (ROC stands for receiver operating characteristic, and ROC curve is a graphical plot which illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied) value of 97.98%. Finally, we also compare our proposed method with traditional invasive diagnosis and noninvasive cancer diagnosis relying on cytomorphology, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Unlike former studies focusing on the discrimination between normal and cancerous cells, our study fulfills the classification of 4 graded cell lines at different cancerization stages, and thus provides a potential method for early detection of cancerization. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We measured four cellular mechanical properties (CMPs) of 4 graded bladder cancer (BC) cell lines using AFM (atomic force microscopy). We found that single or dual CMPs cannot fulfill the task of BC cell classification. Instead, we employ MLA (Machine Learning Algorithm)-based analysis whose inputs are BC CMPs. Compared with traditional cytomorphology-based prognoses, the non-invasive method proposed in this study has higher accuracy but with many fewer cellular properties as inputs. The proposed non-invasive prognosis is characterized with high sensitivity and specificity, and thus provides a potential tumor-grading means to identify cancer cells with different metastatic potential. Moreover, our study proposes an objective grading method based on quantitative characteristics desirable for avoiding misdiagnosis induced by ambiguous subjectivity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//36581006/,2020

We seek to classify the cancer's origin and tissue identification using the expression from 1046 reported miRNAs. Despite an apparent uniform appearance of miRNAs among cancerous samples, we recover indispensable information from lowly expressed miRNAs regarding the cancer/tissue types. Multiclass support vector machine classification yields an average recall of 58% in identifying the correct tissue and tumor types.

Cancer is thus a biological process of considerable precision as described by Schrödinger's equation, and it is not simply the random expression of hundreds of genes, but rather a program that gives neoplastic tissue characteristics that are independent of the originating tissue: invasion capacity and destruction of neighbouring tissues, metastasis, and capacity to progressively disengage from the genetic program of the original tissue. This program is common to all types of cancer, and does not appear to be related to the genetic program of any known differentiated tissue. In other words, cancer's genetic program appears to be universal in all tissues, since cancer behaves similarly in all tissues; though depending on the tissue in which it originates it will show certain specific characteristics, reflecting the extent to which the neoplastic cells are able to escape from the characteristics of the original tissue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19136220/,2020

Establishment of permutation forcancerrisk estimation in the urothelium based on genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.,"Koji Tsumura, Eri Arai, Ying Tian, Ayako Shibuya, Hiroshi Nishihara, Takuya Yotani, Yuriko Yamada, Yoriko Takahashi, Akiko Miyagi Maeshima, Hiroyuki Fujimoto, Tohru Nakagawa, Haruki Kume, Yukio Homma, Teruhiko Yoshida, Yae Kanai, Koji Tsumura, Eri Arai, Ying Tian, Ayako Shibuya, Hiroshi Nishihara, Takuya Yotani, Yuriko Yamada, Yoriko Takahashi, Akiko Miyagi Maeshima, Hiroyuki Fujimoto, Tohru Nakagawa, Haruki Kume, Yukio Homma, Teruhiko Yoshida, Yae Kanai","The aim of this study was to establish permutation for cancer risk estimation in the urothelium. Twenty-six samples of normal control urothelium obtained from patients without urothelial carcinomas (C), 47 samples of non-cancerous urothelium without noticeable morphological changes obtained from patients with urothelial carcinomas (N), and 46 samples of the corresponding cancerous tissue (T) in the learning cohort and 64 N samples in the validation cohort, i.e. 183 tissue samples in total, were analyzed. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip, and DNA methylation levels were verified using pyrosequencing and MassARRAY. Amplicon sequencing was performed using the GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2. Although N samples rarely showed genetic mutations or copy number alterations, they showed DNA methylation alterations at 2502 CpG sites compared to C samples, and such alterations were inherited by or strengthened in T samples, indicating that DNA methylation alterations may participate in field cancerization in the urothelium. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the feasibility of cancer risk estimation to identify urothelium at the precancerous stage by DNA methylation quantification. Cancer risk estimation permutation was established using a combination of two marker CpG loci on the HOXC4, TENM3 and TLR1 genes (sensitivity and specificity 96-100%). Among them, the diagnostic impact of 10 patterns of permutation was successfully validated in the validation cohort (sensitivity and specificity 94-98%). These data suggest that cancer risk estimation using procedures such as urine tests during health checkups might become applicable for clinical use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//31241739/,2018

The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had multiple primary cancer.Results:Totally 369 (11.9%) patients were found multiple primary cancer in the other organs. Among these patients, 72.4% was found synchronously, another primary cancer was found in the head and neck region in 211 (6.8%), in the stomach in 140 (4.2%), and in the lung, colon, breast, and other locations in the remaining patients. Of the 211 patients with another primary cancer in the head and neck region, 156 (73.2%) had hypopharyngeal cancer. Furthermore, the incidence of intraesophageal multiple cancerous lesion in the patients with primary cancer in the head and neck region was significantly higher than that in those whose other primary cancers were gastric cancer or in those with non-multiple primary cancer (P<0.01).Conclusion:There is a high incidence of multiple primary cancers in patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma, mostly found synchronously. The leading multiple primary cancers were head and neck cancer and stomach cancer. Intraesophageal multiple cancerous lesion is an indicator for a second primary cancer in head and neck. A better knowledge of the relationships between esophageal carcinoma and cancers in other organs may lead to earlier detection of other primary cancers and improved therapeutic results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//26815192/,2023

This paper presents outcomes for the first cohort of participants (n = 36) of a Screening for Psychosocial Distress Program (SPDP), a 2-year training program designed to assist clinicians in implementing routine distress screening as mandated by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer. Specifically, participants' success with distress screening implementation, institutional barriers and facilitators to implementation, and the role of the SPDP are described.Method:This research followed a longitudinal pre- and posttest mixed methods design. An investigator-developed questionnaire collected qualitative (distress screening goals, institutional barriers and facilitators, facilitators associated with participation in the SPDP) and quantitative (level of goal achievement) data at 6, 12, and 24 months of participation in the SPDP. Conventional content analysis was applied to qualitative data. Mixed methods data analysis in Dedoose evaluated (1) types and number of distress screening goals, barriers, and facilitators, and (2) goal achievement at 6, 12, and 24 months of participation.ResultNinety-five percent of distress screening implementation goals were completed after 2 years of participation. Most common institutional barriers to distress screening implementation were ""lack of staff,"" ""competing demands,"" and ""staff turn-over."" Most common institutional facilitators were ""buy-in,"" ""institutional support,"" and ""recognition of participants' expertise."" The number of reported facilitators associated with SPDP participation was higher than the number associated with any institutional factor, and increased over time of participation.Significance of resultsParticipating in training programs to implement distress screening may facilitate successful achievement of the Commission on Cancer's distress screening standard, and benefits seem to increase with time of participation. Training programs are needed to promote facilitators and overcome barriers to distress screening.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//29880068/,2019

This investigation aims to elucidate the expression dynamics of calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39) in both healthy and cancerous tissues and to explore its functional role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within human bladder cancer contexts. Utilizing immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription analyses, we assessed CAB39 expression across BC specimens and cell lines. Further, we implemented wound healing, cell invasion, and CCK-8 proliferation assays in CAB39-knockdown cell lines, alongside a nude mouse xenograft model, to gauge the impact of diminished CAB39 expression on the invasive, migratory, and proliferative capacities of BC cells. Our gene set enrichment analysis probed into the repertoire of genes augmented by increased CAB39 expression in BC cells, with subsequent validation via western blotting. Our findings reveal a pronounced overexpression of CAB39 in both BC tissues and cellular models, inversely correlated with disease prognosis. Remarkably, the oncogenic trajectory of bladder cancer was mitigated upon the establishment of shRNA-mediated CAB39 knockdown in vitro and in vivo, effectively reversing the cancer's invasive and metastatic behaviors and curbing tumorigenesis in xenograft models. Hence, CAB39 emerges as a critical biomarker for bladder cancer progression, significantly implicated in facilitating EMT via the upregulation of neural cadherin (N-cadherin) and the suppression of epithelial cadherin through NF-κB signaling pathways. CU-T12-9 effectively overturned the downregulation of p65-NF-kB and N-cadherin, key elements involved in EMT and cell motility, induced by CAB39 knockdown. This study underscores CAB39's pivotal role in bladder cancer pathophysiology and its potential as a therapeutic target.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//39171884/,2016

Furthermore, breast cancer cells have an impressive metabolic plasticity that is regulated by the heterogeneous tumour microenvironment through bidirectional interactions. The structure and accessibility of nutrients within this unstable microenvironment influence the metabolism of cancer cells that shift between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In this scenario, the mitochondrial energetic pathways of cancer cells can be reprogrammed to modulate breast cancer's progression and aggressiveness. Moreover, mitochondrial alterations can lead to crosstalk between the mitochondria and the nucleus, and subsequently affect cancer tissue properties. This article reviewed the metabolic plasticity of breast cancer cells, focussing mainly on breast cancer mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and the mitochondrial alterations influencing nuclear pathways. Finally, the therapeutic strategies targeting molecules and pathways regulating cancer mitochondrial alterations are highlighted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//31052256/,2019

Fatty acid metabolites in rapidly proliferating breastcancer.,"Joseph T O'Flaherty, Rhonda E Wooten, Michael P Samuel, Michael J Thomas, Edward A Levine, L Douglas Case, Steven A Akman, Iris J Edwards, Joseph T O'Flaherty, Rhonda E Wooten, Michael P Samuel, Michael J Thomas, Edward A Levine, L Douglas Case, Steven A Akman, Iris J Edwards","Purpose:Breast cancers that over-express a lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase are associated with poor survival possibly because they overproduce metabolites that alter the cancer's malignant behaviors. However, these metabolites and behaviors have not been identified. We here identify which metabolites among those that stimulate breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro are associated with rapidly proliferating breast cancer.Experimental design:We used selective ion monitoring-mass spectrometry to quantify in the cancer and normal breast tissue of 27 patients metabolites that stimulate (15-, 12-, 5-hydroxy-, and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoate, 13-hydroxy-octadecaenoate [HODE]) or inhibit (prostaglandin [PG]E2 and D2) breast cancer cell proliferation. We then related their levels to each cancer's proliferation rate as defined by its Mib1 score.Results:13-HODE was the only metabolite strongly, significantly, and positively associated with Mib1 scores. It was similarly associated with aggressive grade and a key component of grade, mitosis, and also trended to be associated with lymph node metastasis. PGE2 and PGD2 trended to be negatively associated with these markers. No other metabolite in cancer and no metabolite in normal tissue had this profile of associations.Conclusions:Our data fit a model wherein the overproduction of 13-HODE by 15-lipoxygenase-1 shortens breast cancer survival by stimulating its cells to proliferate and possibly metastasize; no other oxygenase-metabolite pathway, including cyclooxygenase-PGE2/D2 pathways, uses this specific mechanism to shorten survival.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//23658799/,2022

This study examined life disruptions and related supports to update interventions to improve psychological outcomes.Methods:In April-July 2023, young adult survivors (n= 23) were recruited (via clinics, support groups, nonprofit organizations, etc.) to complete semi-structured interviews assessing cancer's impact across life domains, how they coped with related disruptions, and facilitators to improved psychosocial well-being. We used a dual deductive-inductive approach to develop a codebook and then coded transcripts in Dedoose.Results:This sample was on average 33.7 years old (standard deviation [SD] = 4.4), 78.3% female, 73.9% non-Hispanic White, 47.8% married/cohabitating, 2.4 (SD = 1.0) years post-diagnosis, 1.4 years (SD = 0.9) post-treatment, and largely diagnosed with breast cancer (52.1%) or leukemia/lymphoma (34.7%). The most salient themes related to disruptions included mental health, feelings of isolation during survivorship, and disruptions to career and relationships with family or partners. Participants reported challenges navigating these feelings and disruptions, and difficulty understanding and conveying their needs. Many experienced limited support for navigating cancer-related trauma and life disruptions as a survivor. Participants also reported some positive impacts, like reevaluating their values and goals or feeling resilient, and emphasized the need to identify supports, accept that life had changed because of cancer, and have their needs and continued struggles validated by others during survivorship.Conclusions:Young adults experience ongoing disruptions across multiple life domains, underscoring the need for integrated, longer-term psychosocial supports to help them navigate these disruptions and reevaluate their goals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//38695773/,2020

Fieldcancerizationin the understanding of parenchymal analysis of mammograms for breastcancerrisk assessment.,"David A Miranda, Said Pertuz, David A Miranda, Said Pertuz","In recent years, mammographic image analysis has shown great potential for breast cancer risk assessment. The aim of risk assessment is to predict how likely a woman is to develop breast cancer in the future. Several studies suggest that computerized parenchymal analysis of mammograms can be utilized as an independent imaging biomarker of breast cancer. Parenchymal analysis consists of the quantitative assessment of visual texture patterns in mammograms to infer the level of risk. In spite of substantial evidence of the association between parenchymal patterns and breast cancer risk, its biological foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we draw a hypothesis that links the field cancerization (FC) with breast cancer risk assessment based on the parenchymal analysis. In the literature, the FC is interpreted as a biochemical anomaly amplification in otherwise healthy cells due to the effect of pre-cancerous transformed cells in surrounding regions. Our hypothesis is that these biochemical anomaly amplifications change the cellular micro-environment which, in turn, alter tissue responses to X-ray radiation. As a result, it is reasonable to think that these changes influence the interaction of X-rays with parenchymal - the functional - breast tissue thus enabling cancer prediction by analyzing X-ray images of the breast. We believe that our hypothesis provides an actionable explanation as to how computerized parenchymal analysis of apparently normal mammograms can be successfully utilized for the stratification of breast cancer risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//31837523/,2016

Children with cancer can feel isolation, such as bullying and lack of engagement, from their peers. As the rates of survival increase, one way to further learn about the experiences of childhood cancer is to reflect on the memories of adult survivors. This study examines adult survivors of childhood cancer's memories of their experiences with peers during their cancer.Method:Twenty-seven adult survivors (15 male, 12 female) of childhood cancer were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing marketplace for survey distribution, and surveyed about their experiences with peers during childhood cancer. Using inductive thematic analysis, open-ended survey questions were analyzed.Results:Five main themes emerged, including age, perceptions of cancer, acts of kindness, peer responses, and limited peer engagement. Participants' memories included peers' lack of understanding about their diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, positive and negative responses to their cancer diagnosis, acts of services and gifts from peers, and feelings of isolation during the cancer experience.Discussion:In the current study, adult survivors of childhood cancer had specific memories about how cancer impacted peer relationships.

Exhaustive Review on LungCancers: Novel Technologies.,"Sajad Khan, Shahid Ali, Muhammad, Sajad Khan, Shahid Ali, Muhammad","Background:Lung cancers or (Bronchogenic-Carcinomas) are the disease in certain parts of the lungs in which irresistible multiplication of abnormal cells leads to the inception of a tumor. Lung cancers consisting of two substantial forms based on the microscopic appearance of tumor cells are: Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer (NSCLC) (80 to 85%) and Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer (SCLC) (15 to 20%).Discussion:Lung cancers are existing luxuriantly across the globe and the most prominent cause of death in advanced countries (USA & UK). There are many causes of lung cancers in which the utmost imperative aspect is the cigarette smoking. During the early stage, there is no perspicuous sign/symptoms but later many symptoms emerge in the infected individual such as insomnia, headache, pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, coughing etc. Lung cancers can be diagnosed in many ways, such as history, physical examination, chest X-rays and biopsy. However, after the diagnosis and confirmation of lung carcinoma, various treatment approaches are existing for curing of cancer in different stages such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immune therapy. Currently, novel techniques merged that revealed advancements in detection and curing of lung cancer in which mainly includes: microarray analysis, gene expression profiling.Conclusion:Consequently, the purpose of the current analysis is to specify and epitomize the novel literature pertaining to the development of cancerous cells in different parts of the lung, various preeminent approaches of prevention, efficient diagnostic procedure, and treatments along with novel technologies for inhibition of cancerous cell growth in advance stages.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//32013812/,2020
"Cancercontrol through principles of systems science, complexity, and chaos theory: a model.","Ivo P Janecka, Ivo P Janecka","Cancer is a significant medical and societal problem. This reality arises from the fact that an exponential and an unrestricted cellular growth destabilizes human body as a system. From this perspective, cancer is a manifestation of a system-in-failing.A model of normal and abnormal cell cycle oscillations has been developed incorporating systems science, complexity, and chaos theories. Using this model, cancer expresses a failing subsystem and is characterized by a positive exponential growth taking place in the outer edge of chaos. The overall survival of human body as a system is threatened. This model suggests, however, that cancer's exponential cellular growth and disorganized complexity could be controlled through the process of induction of differentiation of cancer stem cells into cells of low and basic functionality. This concept would imply reorientation of current treatment principles from cellular killing (cyto-toxic therapies) to cellular retraining (cyto-education).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17589568/,2021
Marriage aftercancerin older adulthood.,"Astri Syse, Gjøril Bergva Aas, Astri Syse, Gjøril Bergva Aas","Introduction:Cancer's impact on family formation in older adulthood is not well described. Marriage rates among older adults were therefore explored.Method:Data on the unmarried Norwegian population aged 45-80 in 1974-2001 (N = 306 000) was retrieved from the Cancer Registry, the Central Population Register, and population censuses. Marriage rates for 27,600 persons diagnosed with cancer were compared to those of the general population by means of discrete-time hazard regression models.Results:Men with cancer had a similar marriage rate as cancer-free men, whereas women experienced a 25% marriage deficit after cancer. This deficit was most pronounced after ovarian (OR 0.48) and breast (OR 0.69) cancer. Marriage rates decreased with time from diagnosis. No cancer forms elevated marriage rates.Conclusion:Marriage rates among older male cancer survivors are similar to those of the general population. Ovarian and breast cancer in older women was associated with pronounced marriage deficits. A possible explanation is that these gender-specific cancers relate to aspects of persons' psychological well-being, body image, and sense of femininity. Long-term adverse treatment effects are also common for the cancers in question. To explore explanations further, more details on treatment and illness progression are needed.Implications for cancer survivors:Increased awareness of how ovarian and breast cancer may affect (prospects of) interpersonal relationships is valuable for cancer survivors and clinicians, and may facilitate communication of relevant, related issues during consultations. Our findings may suggest a need for more extensive psychosocial follow-up after these gender-specific cancer forms in older women, but further research is clearly warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19148756/,2020

Epigenetic impact of infection on carcinogenesis: mechanisms and applications.,"Naoko Hattori, Toshikazu Ushijima, Naoko Hattori, Toshikazu Ushijima","Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers. Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression. Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called 'epigenetic field for cancerization'. Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells. From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk. Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model. Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//26823082/,2016

Reactive oxygen species: a volatile driver of fieldcancerizationand metastasis.,"Zehuan Liao, Damien Chua, Nguan Soon Tan, Zehuan Liao, Damien Chua, Nguan Soon Tan","Field cancerization and metastasis are the leading causes for cancer recurrence and mortality in cancer patients. The formation of primary, secondary tumors or metastasis is greatly influenced by multifaceted tumor-stroma interactions, in which stromal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can affect the behavior of the cancer cells. Many studies have identified cytokines and growth factors as cell signaling molecules that aid cell to cell communication. However, the functional contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a family of volatile chemicals, as communication molecules are less understood. Cancer cells and various tumor-associated stromal cells produce and secrete a copious amount of ROS into the TME. Intracellular ROS modulate cell signaling cascades that aid in the acquisition of several hallmarks of cancers. Extracellular ROS help to propagate, amplify, and effectively create a mutagenic and oncogenic field which facilitate the formation of multifoci tumors and act as a springboard for metastatic tumor cells. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of ROS as atypical paracrine signaling molecules for field cancerization and metastasis. Field cancerization and metastasis are often discussed separately; we offer a model that placed these events with ROS as the focal instigating agent in a broader ""seed-soil"" hypothesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//30927919/,2021
Immune-mediated paraneoplasia.,"C E Thirkill, C E Thirkill","Cancers induce a loss of homeostasis through the uncontrolled production and release of a variety of biologically active cellular products, natural compounds produced in unnatural quantities within abnormal anatomical locations. Often, there is an immune response to which the cancerous growth may succumb, or have the characteristics required to survive. If, during its proliferation, the cancer should coincidentally express a potent autoantigen then the organ in which that antigen is normally located may be damaged by the resultant immune response. Paradoxically, this aberrant immunological activity rarely has any appreciable inhibitory effects on the causal cancer. This inconsistency may result from the cancer's ability to block the host's immunological activity, while the affected organ situated elsewhere has no such capacity. Some predisposition, such as trauma to the affected organ, may prove a prerequisite that provides access to hitherto immunologically privileged sites. The effects of the subsequent loss of tolerance are often the first indication of a health problem, prompting the patient to seek medical help. Immune-mediated paraneoplasia is identified by antibody activity with any of a small but growing collection of organ-specific antigens demonstrated to have a distinct disease association and an apparent involvement in autoimmunity. Examples of the most common are described as introduction to this unusual collection of autoimmune diseases, for which in some cases the cause is known, and these may provide insight into the cause of those that are not.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17201211/,2020

Game of clones: Battles in the field of carcinogenesis.,"Zahraa Rahal, Ansam Sinjab, Ignacio I Wistuba, Humam Kadara, Zahraa Rahal, Ansam Sinjab, Ignacio I Wistuba, Humam Kadara","Recent advances in bulk sequencing approaches as well as genomic decoding at the single-cell level have revealed surprisingly high somatic mutational burdens in normal tissues, as well as increased our understanding of the landscape of ""field cancerization"", that is, molecular and immune alterations in mutagen-exposed normal-appearing tissues that recapitulated those present in tumors. Charting the somatic mutational landscapes in normal tissues can have strong implications on our understanding of how tumors arise from mutagenized epithelium. Making sense of those mutations to understand the progression along the pathologic continuum of normal epithelia, preneoplasias, up to malignant tissues will help pave way for identification of ideal targets that can guide new strategies for preventing or eliminating cancers at their earliest stages of development. In this review, we will provide a brief history of field cancerization and its implications on understanding early stages of cancer pathogenesis and deviation from the pathologically ""normal"" state. The review will provide an overview of how mutations accumulating in normal tissues can lead to a patchwork of mutated cell clones that compete while maintaining an overall state of functional homeostasis. The review also explores the role of clonal competition in directing the fate of normal tissues and summarizes multiple mechanisms elicited in this phenomenon and which have been linked to cancer development. Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding mutations in normal tissues, as well as clonal competition dynamics (in both the epithelium and the microenvironment) and their significance in exploring new approaches to combatting cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//35850404/,2022
FieldCancerizationin NSCLC: A New Perspective on MicroRNAs in Macrophage Polarization.,"Radu Pirlog, Andrei Cismaru, Andreea Nutu, Ioana Berindan-Neagoe, Radu Pirlog, Andrei Cismaru, Andreea Nutu, Ioana Berindan-Neagoe","Lung cancer is currently the first cause of cancer-related death. The major lung cancer subtype is non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which accounts for approximatively 85% of cases. The major carcinogenic associated with lung cancer is tobacco smoke, which produces long-lasting and progressive damage to the respiratory tract. The progressive and diffuse alterations that occur in the respiratory tract of patients with cancer and premalignant lesions have been described as field cancerization. At the level of tumor cells, adjacent tumor microenvironment (TME) and cancerized field are taking place dynamic interactions through direct cell-to-cell communication or through extracellular vesicles. These molecular messages exchanged between tumor and nontumor cells are represented by proteins, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). In this paper, we analyze the miRNA roles in the macrophage polarization at the level of TME and cancerized field in NSCLC. Identifying molecular players that can influence the phenotypic states at the level of malignant cells, tumor microenvironment and cancerized field can provide us new insights into tumor regulatory mechanisms that can be further modulated to restore the immunogenic capacity of the TME. This approach could revert alterations in the cancerized field and could enhance currently available therapy approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//33451052/,2023

Clinically, some recurrent ovarian cancers show the same therapeutic sensitivities to chemotherapy and surgery as did the primary disease, whereas others are refractory to all therapy. We hypothesize that recurrent ovarian cancers are distinguishable on the basis of a molecular genetic fingerprint and that some are actually new primary cancers of the peritoneum rather than recurrent ovarian cancer.Study design:We constructed molecular genetic fingerprints of 13 paired primary and late recurrent ovarian cancers to study their clonal relationships. The tumor pairs were analyzed for p53 mutations and allelotypes, patterns of X-chromosome inactivation, loss of heterozygosity, and microsatellite instability at 12 different loci on 6 different chromosomes. Techniques used included single-strand conformational polymorphism mutation screening and polymerase chain reaction-based sequence analysis of the p53 locus, restriction digestion of the androgen receptor locus to determine X-chromosome inactivation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of highly polymorphic dinucleotide, trinucleotide, and tetranucleotide repeats.Results:The average age at initial diagnosis for this cohort was 54.7 years (range 45.3 to 65.5). Mean interval to recurrence was 42.7 months (range 28 to 62). Molecular fingerprints were characterized for 4 to 8 informative loci per tumor pair. The fingerprints of 10 (77%) differed significantly, strongly suggesting that a second primary cancer had developed. The remaining 3 tumor pairs demonstrated identical allelotypes consistent with regrowth of dormant tumor cells.Conclusion:Our results are consistent with the ""field cancerization"" hypothesis of ovarian carcinogenesis but could also be explained by a polyclonal tumor origin, which contrasts with the currently accepted monoclonal theory of ovarian carcinogenesis. Late development of a new primary cancer may herald the proband as a member of a familial cancer phenotype. These studies provide a molecular genetic rationale that both explains and prognosticates the clinical course of recurrent ovarian cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//9579425/,2016

This finding led to the field cancerization theory, which suggests that the entire epithelial surface of the regional skin has an increased risk for the development of malignant lesions. Management of field change is challenging, taking into account the high impact of NMSCs on public health and healthcare costs. Objectives We sought to investigate whether field-photodynamic therapy (PDT) of extreme photodamaged skin would prevent new NMSCs, in comparison with a control area receiving placebo-PDT, in patients with clinical and histological signs of field cancerization. Methods Forty-five patients, previously diagnosed as having NMSCs of the face or scalp, with actinic keratoses symmetrically distributed over the same regions, were randomized for field treatment with 20% aminolaevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT on one side and placebo-PDT on the other. During the next 12-month period of follow up, patients were clinically evaluated for new NMSCs. Results A significant delay in the mean time of appearance and a reduction in the total number of new lesions were observed in the field-PDT protocol, when compared with the control. Conclusions The results obtained showed that field therapy with ALA-PDT confers a significant preventive potential against the formation of new NMSCs in patients with field changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19863513/,2020

One of the many molecular changes described in cancer are microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulates the expression of important genes during carcinogenesis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the field effect in oral cancer.Methods:We investigated the differential expression profile of four miRNAs (hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-135b, and hsa-miR-29c) in cancerous oral tissue, in tumor-adjacent tissue and and in non-cancerous tissue samples from healthy volunteers.Results:Our results showed significant overexpression profiles of all four studied miRNAs in cancerous oral tissue compared to non-cancerous samples, as well as in tumor-adjacent tissue compared to cancer-free tissue. No significant difference was found when comparing the expression profile of cancerous and tissue-adjacent tissue groups.

We are particularly interested in what are ""limit size materials"" because we want to test the feasibility of an idea: could we design, make, develop, and test the concept for treating metastatic cancer by, ""Putting the Drug in the Cancer's Food? ""Limit size"" is the size of the cancer's food, ? the common Low Density Lipoprotein, (LDL) ~20 nm diameter. In this contribution to Pieter's LTAA we focus on the ""bottom"" (nucleation) and the ""up"" (growth) of ""bottom-up design"" as it applies to homogeneous nucleation of especially, hydrophobic drugs and the 8 physico-chemical stages and associated parameters that determine the initial size, and any subsequent coarsening, of a nanoparticle suspension. We show that, when made by the rapid solvent-exchange method, the same sized particles can be obtained without phospholipid. Furthermore, the obtained size follows the predictions of classic nucleation theory when the appropriate values for the parameters (surface tension and supersaturation) at nucleation are included. Calculations on dissolution time for nanoparticles reveal that a typical fewmicromolar-solubility, hydrophobic, anti-cancer drug (like Lapatinib, Niclosamide, Abiraterone, and Fulvestrant) of 500 nm diameter would take between 3?7 s to dissolve in an infinite sink like the blood stream; and a 50 nm particle would dissolve in less than a second! And so the nanoparticle design requires a highly water-insoluble drug, and a tight, encapsulating, impermeable lipid:cholesterol monolayer. While the ""Y"" junction can be used to mix an ethanolic solution with anti-solvent, we find that a ""no-junction"" can give equally good results.

These therapeutic approaches are typically focused on targeting signaling pathways implicated in cell growth and/or survival in order to shrink the malignant mass and achieve an objective clinical response; however, too often these responses are followed by eventual regrowth of the tumor. This clinical conundrum could be explained by the existence of a tumorigenic cell population that is relatively resistant to these therapies and retains pluripotent status in order to repopulate the original tumor and/or contribute to distant metastasis following treatment. Compelling data from liquid tumors, and more recently from studies focused on solid tumors, now support the existence of such tumorigenic cells (i.e., cancer stem cells) as a distinct subpopulation within the total tumor cell mass. These cancer stem cells (CSCs), as compared to the non-CSC population, have the ability to reconstitute the primary tumor phenotype when transplanted into recipient animals. In addition, data are beginning to emerge demonstrating that many standard-of-care chemotherapeutics are less effective in promoting cell death or cytostasis in these putative cancer stem cells as compared to effects in the non-stem cell cancerous cells. Therefore, targeting these locomotive drivers of tumors, the cancer stem cell population, should be considered a high priority in the continued pursuit of more effective cancer therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19539800/,2017

Epigenetic field forcancerization.,"Toshikazu Ushijima, Toshikazu Ushijima","Epigenetic alterations, represented by aberrant DNA methylation, are deeply involved in human cancers. In gastric cancers, tumor-suppressor genes are inactivated more frequently by promoter methylation than by mutations. We recently showed that H. pylori infection, a potent gastric carcinogenic factor, induces methylation of specific genes in the gastric mucosae. When the methylation levels were analyzed in the gastric mucosae of healthy volunteers, cases with a single gastric cancer, and cases with multiple gastric cancers, who have increasing levels of risks for gastric cancers, there was a significant increasing trend in the methylation levels among the individuals without current H. pylori infection. This finding unequivocally showed the presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization. The degree of the field defect was measured more conveniently using methylation levels of marker genes than using those of tumor-suppressor genes. The presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization has been indicated for liver, colon, Barrett's esophageal, lung, breast, and renal cancers. Since decreased transcription is involved in the specificity of methylated genes, it is likely that specific genes are methylated according to carcinogenic factors. These findings emphasize the usefulness of DNA methylation as a marker for past exposure to carcinogens and future risk of cancer development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17394762/,2016

Better understanding of each cancer's behaviour and improvements in surgical techniques necessitate a critical analysis of lymph node disease and the optimal LND template. This review will focus on updates in managing lymph node disease in testicular, penile, upper tract urothelial and urethral cancer.Recent findings:For testicular and penile cancer, advances have focused on reducing the morbidity associated with the standard templates of dissection while maintaining oncologic efficacy. For upper tract urothelial carcinoma, data continue to be mixed regarding the need for a LND, though it does seem to benefit patients with advanced tumours. Little is known regarding the optimal LND template for urethral cancer.Summary:A thorough LND has an established diagnostic and therapeutic role in testicular and penile cancer. For upper tract urothelial carcinoma, the role of an LND remains controversial, though emerging evidence points to an association with improved outcomes. Due to the rarity of urethral cancer, there are no standard LND templates, though excising clinically positive nodes is recommended.

These activities confer on cancer its malignant potential, working as they do autonomously, free from higher levels of integrated control. Taking advantage of cancer's mechanisms of malignancy by employing exogenous insulin as a biologic response modifier, it is possible to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents for improved treatment of cancer.

The hamster cheek pouch model for fieldcancerizationstudies.,"Andrea Monti-Hughes, Romina F Aromando, Miguel A Pérez, Amanda E Schwint, Maria E Itoiz, Andrea Monti-Hughes, Romina F Aromando, Miguel A Pérez, Amanda E Schwint, Maria E Itoiz","External carcinogens, such as tobacco and alcohol, induce molecular changes in large areas of oral mucosa, which increase the risk of malignant transformation. This condition, known as 'field cancerization', can be detected in biopsy specimens using histochemical techniques, even before histological alterations are identified. The efficacy of these histochemical techniques as biomarkers of early cancerization must be demonstrated in appropriate models. The hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model, universally employed in biological studies and in studies for the prevention and treatment of oral cancer, is also an excellent model of field cancerization. The carcinogen is applied in solution to the surface of the mucosa and induces alterations that recapitulate the stages of cancerization in human oral mucosa. We have demonstrated that the following can be used for the early detection of cancerized tissue: silver staining of nucleolar organizer regions; the Feulgen reaction to stain DNA followed by ploidy analysis; immunohistochemical analysis of fibroblast growth factor-2, immunohistochemical labeling of proliferating cells to demonstrate an increase of epithelial cell proliferation in the absence of inflammation; and changes in markers of angiogenesis (i.e. those indicating vascular endothelial growth factor activity, endothelial cell proliferation and vascular density). The hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer was also proposed and validated by our group for boron neutron capture therapy studies for the treatment of oral cancer. Clinical trials of this novel treatment modality have been performed and are underway for certain tumor types and localizations. Having demonstrated the efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy to control tumors in the hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model, we adapted the model for the long-term study of field cancerized tissue. We demonstrated the inhibitory effect of boron neutron capture therapy on tumor development in field cancerized tissue with acceptable levels of mucositis, a dose-limiting side-effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25494606/,2023

Are macrophages in tumors good targets for novel therapeutic approaches?,"Samthosh V Alahari, Shengli Dong, Suresh K Alahari, Samthosh V Alahari, Shengli Dong, Suresh K Alahari","The development of cancer has been an extensively researched topic over the past few decades. Although great strides have been made in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is still much to be learned about cancer's micro-environmental mechanisms that contribute to cancer formation and aggressiveness. Macrophages, lymphocytes which originate from monocytes, are involved in the inflammatory response and often dispersed to areas of infection to fight harmful antigens and mutated cells in tissues. Macrophages have a plethora of roles including tissue development and repair, immune system functions, and inflammation. We discuss various pathways by which macrophages get activated, various approaches that can regulate the function of macrophages, and how these approaches can be helpful in developing new cancer therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25518927/,2022

Circulating Tumor DNA Allele Fraction: A Candidate Biological Signal for Multicancer Early Detection Tests to Assess the Clinical Significance ofCancers.,"Joerg Bredno, Oliver Venn, Xiaoji Chen, Peter Freese, Joshua J Ofman, Joerg Bredno, Oliver Venn, Xiaoji Chen, Peter Freese, Joshua J Ofman","Current imaging-based cancer screening approaches provide useful but limited prognostic information. Complementary to existing screening tests, cell-free DNA-based multicancer early detection (MCED) tests account for cancer biology [manifested through circulating tumor allele fraction (cTAF)], which could inform prognosis and help assess the cancer's clinical significance. This review discusses the factors affecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels and cTAF, and their correlation with the cancer's clinical significance. Furthermore, it discusses the influence of cTAF on MCED test performance, which could help inform prognosis. Clinically significant cancers show higher ctDNA levels quantified by cTAF than indolent phenotype cancers within each stage. This is because more frequent mitosis and cell death combined with increased trafficking of cell-free DNA into circulation leads to greater vascularization and depth of tumor invasion. cTAF has been correlated with biomarkers for cancer aggressiveness and overall survival; cancers with lower cTAF had better survival when compared with cancers as determined by the higher cTAF and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-based survival for that cancer type at each stage. MCED-detected cancers in case-control studies had comparable survival to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-based survival at each stage. Because many MCED tests use ctDNA as an analyte, cTAF could provide a common metric to compare performance. The prognostic value of cTAF may allow MCED tests to preferentially detect clinically significant cancers at early stages when outcomes are favorable and this may avoid overdiagnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//35948080/,2021

Personalized therapy in oncology: melanoma as a paradigm for molecular-targeted treatment approaches.,"Kevin B Kim, Kevin B Kim","In recent decades, the field of systemic cancer treatment has seen remarkable changes due to advancements in the understanding of cancer's biology, immunology, and genetic makeup. As a result, individuals with late-stage cancers are now achieving survival rates that were previously unattainable. The goal of personalized cancer therapy is to enhance clinical outcomes by customizing drug treatments to suit the unique genetic and/or epigenetic profiles of each patient's tumor. This approach aims to reduce the side effects commonly associated with ineffective treatments. Advances in genetic sequencing and molecular cytogenetics have been instrumental in identifying cancer-driving mutations and epigenetic irregularities, leading to the development of specific molecular therapies.

Integration of pain management into comprehensivecancercare.,"M H Levy, M H Levy","Pain management is an integral component of comprehensive cancer care. Designing an effective pain control strategy for the individual patient requires knowledge of the ways in which a patient's cancer, cancer therapy, and pain therapy can interact. Two important aspects of cancer that affect the way in which pain is managed are the cancer's treatability and components of its pathophysiology that themselves do not cause pain (the cancer's ""nonpain"" pathophysiology). Cancer treatability modifies the need for pain management and the appropriateness of invasive pain procedures. Cancer nonpain pathophysiology can interfere with the oral administration of medications, narrow the patient's therapeutic window for analgesic drugs, limit the effectiveness of psychologic pain therapies, and complicate or preclude invasive pain-relieving procedures. In addition, cancer therapy can interfere with or enhance pain therapy and vice versa. Cancer therapy can interfere with pain therapy by causing pain or by producing other adverse effects. Cancer therapy can enhance pain therapy by reducing the extent of cancer, by acting as a coanalgesic, and by providing intravenous access for parenteral drug administration to patients who require it. Pain therapy can interfere with cancer therapy by increasing or complicating the adverse effects of cancer therapy. Pain therapy can enhance cancer therapy by improving patient performance, and certain palliative surgical procedures may have the ancillary effect of improving organ function. Five case descriptions are presented as illustrations of effective integration of pain management into comprehensive cancer care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//2470492/,2019
Automated tumor segmentation in thermographic breast images.,"Thaweesak Trongtirakul, Sos Agaian, Adel Oulefki, Thaweesak Trongtirakul, Sos Agaian, Adel Oulefki","Identifying and delineating suspicious regions in thermal breast images poses significant challenges for radiologists during the examination and interpretation of thermogram images. This paper aims to tackle concerns related to enhancing the differentiation between cancerous regions and the background to achieve uniformity in the intensity of breast cancer's (BC) existence. Furthermore, it aims to effectively segment tumors that exhibit limited contrast with the background and extract relevant features that can distinguish tumors from the surrounding tissue. A new cancer segmentation scheme comprised of two primary stages is proposed to tackle these challenges. In the first stage, an innovative image enhancement technique based on local image enhancement with a hyperbolization function is employed to significantly improve the quality and contrast of breast imagery. This technique enhances the local details and edges of the images while preserving global brightness and contrast. In the second stage, a dedicated algorithm based on an image-dependent weighting strategy is employed to accurately segment tumor regions within the given images. This algorithm assigns different weights to different pixels based on their similarity to the tumor region and uses a thresholding method to separate the tumor from the background. The proposed enhancement and segmentation methods were evaluated using the Database for Mastology Research (DMR-IR). The experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance, with an average segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity coefficient values of 97%, 80%, and 99%, respectively. These findings convincingly establish the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art techniques. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to aid in the early detection of breast cancer through improved diagnosis and interpretation of thermogram images.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//37920034/,2020

The value of genomics in dissecting the RAS-network and in guiding therapeutics for RAS-drivencancers.,"Gajendra Shrestha, Shelley M MacNeil, Jasmine A McQuerry, David F Jenkins, Sunil Sharma, Andrea H Bild, Gajendra Shrestha, Shelley M MacNeil, Jasmine A McQuerry, David F Jenkins, Sunil Sharma, Andrea H Bild","The rise in genomic knowledge over the past decade has revealed the molecular etiology of many diseases, and has identified intricate signaling network activity in human cancers. Genomics provides the opportunity to determine genome structure and capture the activity of thousands of molecular events concurrently, which is important for deciphering highly complex genetic diseases such as cancer. In this review, we focus on genomic efforts directed towards one of cancer's most frequently mutated networks, the RAS pathway. Genomic tools such as gene expression signatures and assessment of mutations across the RAS network enable the capture of RAS signaling complexity. Due to this high level of interaction and cross-talk within the network, efforts to target RAS signaling in the clinic have generally failed, and we currently lack the ability to directly inhibit the RAS protein with high efficacy. We propose that the use of gene expression data can identify effective treatments that broadly inhibit the RAS network as this approach measures pathway activity independent of mutation status or any single mechanism of activation. Here, we review the genomic studies that map the complexity of the RAS network in cancer, and that show how genomic measurements of RAS pathway activation can identify effective RAS inhibition strategies. We also address the challenges and future directions for treating RAS-driven tumors. In summary, genomic assessment of RAS signaling provides a level of complexity necessary to accurately map the network that matches the intricacy of RAS pathway interactions in cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//27338857/,2022

Effective integration of pain management into comprehensivecancercare.,"M H Levy, M H Levy","Pain management is an integral component of comprehensive cancer care. The combined goals of optimal comfort and optimal function require a working understanding of how pain therapy interacts with cancer and cancer therapy. The two main aspects of cancer which affect pain management are the cancer's treatability and its non-pain pathophysiology. Cancer treatability determines the importance of pain management and the appropriateness of invasive pain-blocking procedures. Cancer non-pain pathophysiology often hinders pain control by preventing oral administration of medications, narrowing a patient's therapeutic window for opioid analgesics, limiting psychological therapies, and interfering with invasive pain relieving procedures. Cancer therapy can impair or enhance pain therapy and vice versa. Cancer therapy can impair pain therapy by its production of adverse effects or by its direct causation of pain. Cancer therapy can enhance pain therapy by reducing the amount of cancer, by including drugs which act as coanalgesics, and by providing intravenous access devices for parenteral opioid administration. Pain therapy can impair cancer therapy by augmenting or complicating cancer therapy's adverse effects.

The hydra phenomenon ofcancer: why tumors recur locally after microscopically complete resection.,"Michael Höckel, Nadja Dornhöfer, Michael Höckel, Nadja Dornhöfer","After surgical resection with microscopically clear margins, solid malignant tumors recur locally in up to 50%. Although the effect of a local tumor recurrence on the overall survival may be low in common cancers such as carcinoma of the breast or prostate, the affected patients suffer from exacerbated fear and the burden of the secondary treatment. With some tumor entities such as carcinoma of the uterine cervix or carcinoma of the head and neck, a local recurrence indicates incurability in the majority of cases. The pathomechanisms of local tumor spread and relapse formation are still unclear and comparatively little research has been devoted to their elucidation. Through the analysis of clinical and molecular data, we propose the concept of two pathogenetically and prognostically different local relapse types (i) in situ recurrences that arise in the residual organ/organ system not involved in the surgery for the primary tumor and (ii) scar recurrences that develop at the site of previous tumor resection. Whereas field cancerization, the monoclonal or multiclonal displacement of normal epithelium by a genetically altered but microscopically undistinguishable homologue, may explain the origin of in situ recurrences, most scar recurrences are regarded as the result of the interaction of minimal residual microscopically occult cancer with the surgical wound environment inside a developmentally defined tissue or organ compartment.

A biocompatible and magnetic nanocarrier with a safe UV-initiated docetaxel release andcancersecretion removal properties increases therapeutic potential for skincancer.,"Fei Kong, Xiao Huang, Danyang Yue, Jun Pan, Fei Kong, Xiao Huang, Danyang Yue, Jun Pan","Cancer is a leading fatal disease worldwide. To increase its therapeutic efficiency, more effective with less side effect and patient acceptable administration approach is expected. Moreover, modification of tumor microenvironment is proved to be operative recently. In this paper, a nanocarrier named LDEDDS was developed for intelligent tropical administration of skin cancer, along with removal of hydrophobic cancerous secretion to change tumor microenvironment. It was made by coating of amphipathic polymer P(BA-co-HBA) on docetaxel (TXT, a model hydrophobic anticancer drug) loaded Fe3O4@ZnO. Results showed that an optimal loading rate of TXT in Fe3O4@ZnO was 89.75±0.15%, corresponding to loading capacity of 17.95±2.97% when the mass ratio of Fe3O4@ZnO to TXT was 1:20. The LDEDDS had a narrow distribution size of 115.8nm in average and was superparamagnetic. Without UV radiation, it had low TXT release (<7% in 48h) and cytotoxicity (<14% in 96h) to both the normal and carcinoma skin cells. While under a UV with a dose much lower than physiological dose of normal sunlight, LDEDDS released around 60% and 90% of TXT in 1 and 48h. 1h UV treated LDEDDS removed up to 62% of cancer secreted epidermal growth factor (EGF), a model hydrophobic secretion in 96h. Consequently, 1h UV treated LDEDDS inhibited up to 60% of the growth of skin cancer cells in 96h, overriding those effects of the same concentration of TXT in in vitro cellular experiments. This is the first study to change tumor microenvironment by removal of cancerous secretion and is proved to be effective. Along with the superparamagnetic property, which provides potential for concentrating, increasing penetration and internalization into cancerated cells as well as removing from body under an external magnetic field, we predict LDEDDS will have potential applications in clinic skin cancer therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//28482566/,2017

T cells from tumor-bearing patients are often defective in signaling. They lack the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor and the src kinases crucial for its downstream effects including lck. They truncate the carboxy terminal of the p50 NF-kappaB transcription factor. At the population level, CD4 T cells are polarized toward the Th2 subtype and inhibitory Tregs expand. These T cells can recover after several days of culture outside of the tumor-bearing host environment. The effect is mediated by one or more factors made by the tumor given that the same T-cell defects occur in mice with tumors implanted in hollow fibers that never directly contact cells of the host.

A comparison of hormonal treatments for prostate cancer and those for breast cancer reveals that the genesis of ""hormone-dependent cancer"" as a biomedical category relied upon assumptions that cast androgens and estrogens as opposing ends of a gendered hormonal binary of health and disease. In the 1930s, cancer researchers claimed ""female sex hormones"" (estrogens) exacerbated breast cancer and ""male sex hormones"" (androgens) prevented it. In the early 1940s, Dr. Charles Huggins applied the opposite logic to the treatment of human prostate cancer, which he determined to be ""hormone-dependent.""

Here, we characterized a new mouse model of sporadic thyroid carcinogenesis based on inducible expression of BRAF carrying a Val600 Glu (V600E) point mutation (BRAFV600E) from the thyroglobulin promoter (TgCreERT2). Spontaneous activation of this Braf-mutant allele due to leaky activity of the Cre recombinase revealed that intrinsic properties of thyroid follicles determined BRAF-mutant cell fate. Papillary thyroid carcinomas developed multicentrically within a normal microenvironment. Each tumor originated from a single follicle that provided a confined space for growth of a distinct tumor phenotype. Lineage tracing revealed oligoclonal tumor development in infancy and early selection of BRAFV600E kinase inhibitor-resistant clones. Somatic mutations were few, non-recurrent and limited to advanced tumors. Female mice developed larger tumors than males, reproducing the gender difference of human thyroid cancer. These data indicate that BRAFV600E-induced tumorigenesis is spatiotemporally regulated depending on the maturity and heterogeneity of follicles. Moreover, thyroid tissue organization seems to determine whether a BRAF-mutant lineage becomes a cancerized lineage. The TgCreERT2;BrafCA/+ sporadic thyroid cancer mouse model provides a new tool to evaluate drug therapy at different stages of tumor evolution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//34379110/,2023
"Determinants of enrollment incancerclinical trials: the relationship between the current state of knowledge, societal disease burden, and randomized clinical trial enrollment.","Shane Lloyd, Daniela L Buscariollo, Cary P Gross, Danil V Makarov, James B Yu, Shane Lloyd, Daniela L Buscariollo, Cary P Gross, Danil V Makarov, James B Yu","Whether clinical cancer research currently focuses on gaps in the evidentiary basis for clinical guidelines and/or on cancers that impose greater societal burden is unclear. This study assessed the relationship between cancer research efforts in terms of planned randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrollment, objective measures of evidence quality, and a cancer's burden on society. The authors calculated the planned RCT enrollment listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for the 17 most prevalent solid cancers. Using cancer type as the unit of analysis, linear regression was used to examine the association between planned enrollment in RCTs and 1) evidence quality, as measured by the absolute number and percent of highest quality category (category 1 [C1]) recommendations in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for each cancer, and 2) measures of burden on society, including prevalence, incidence, person-years of life lost (PYLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Non-normal distributions were log transformed when appropriate. Overall, 15% of the NCCN recommendations were based on the highest quality evidence. Results produced 1260 RCTs. Planned RCT enrollment ranged from 2270 (testis) to 492,876 (breast) and was correlated neither with absolute number nor percent of C1 recommendations for that cancer. Planned RCT enrollment was positively correlated with a cancer's prevalence (P=.01), incidence (P<.01), PYLL (P<.01), and DALY (P<0.01). In multivariate analysis, prevalence (P<.01) and PYLL (P<.01) had the strongest association with planned RCT enrollment. Findings showed, therefore, that planned cancer RCT enrollment is associated with higher societal disease burden, not the quality of a cancer's clinical guidelines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//23946172/,2017
"Cutaneous fieldcancerization: clinical, histopathological and therapeutic aspects.","Luís Antônio Ribeiro Torezan, Cyro Festa-Neto, Luís Antônio Ribeiro Torezan, Cyro Festa-Neto","The concept of ""field cancerization"" was first introduced by Slaughter in 1953 when studying the presence of histologically abnormal tissue surrounding oral squamous cell carcinoma. It was proposed to explain the development of multiple primary tumors and locally recurrent cancer. Organ systems in which field cancerization has been described since then are: head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx), lung, vulva, esophagus, cervix, breast, skin, colon, and bladder. Recent molecular studies support the carcinogenesis model in which the development of a field with genetically altered cells plays a central role. An important clinical implication is that fields often remain after the surgery for the primary tumor and may lead to new cancers, designated presently as ""a second primary tumor"" or ""local recurrence,"" depending on the exact site and time interval. In conclusion, the development of an expanding pre-neoplastic field appears to be a critical step in epithelial carcinogenesis with important clinical consequences. Diagnosis and treatment of epithelial cancers should not only be focused on the tumor but also on the field from which it developed. The most important etiopathogenetic, clinical, histopathological and therapeutic aspects of field cancerization are reviewed in this article.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24173184/,2021

Chemoprevention of aerodigestive tractcancers.,"Edward S Kim, Waun Ki Hong, Fadlo Raja Khuri, Edward S Kim, Waun Ki Hong, Fadlo Raja Khuri","Epithelial cancers are a major worldwide health problem. Since the mid-1970s, advances in multidisciplinary cancer therapeutics have only slightly improved the mortality rate from epithelial malignancies. Chemoprevention is the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent progression to invasive cancer. Chemopreventive medicine is based on translating basic biologic research into clinical chemical interventions, thus attempting to impede carcinogenesis. Its principles build on the concepts of field cancerization (diffuse epithelial injury that results from carcinogen exposure) and multistep carcinogenesis (a stepwise accumulation of cellular and genetic alterations that progress to cancer). Chemoprevention targets the carcinogenic process at earlier and potentially more reversible stages, focusing on the inhibition of one or many steps in the progression towards cancer. Strategies of chemoprevention include primary prevention in groups at high risk, reversal of premalignant lesions, and prevention of second primary tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//11818472/,2022

We aimed to investigate whether HPV infection underlies the field cancerization phenomenon over upper aerodigestive tract to develop synchronous multiple cancers.Study design:A case control study.Methods:The presence and subtype of HPV-DNA sequence in cancers were examined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing in a prospective cohort with 100 HNSCCs, 50 of which had synchronous ESCCs. The clinicopathologic characteristics were further analyzed according to the presence of HPV.Results:Twelve patients were HPV-positive, of which 11 were positive for HPV-16. The prevalence of HPV infection were not different between the synchronous and HNSCC alone groups (P = 0.357). Testing for HPV in paired HNSCC and ESCC tissues from the same patient revealed that none were concomitantly HPV-positive. Multivariate logistic regression showed drinking alcohol (odds ratio [OR], 18.75; P = 0.030), alcohol flushing (OR, 2.53; P = 0.041), and body mass index (OR, 0.77; P = 0.001) but not HPV infection were independent risk factors for synchronous phenotype. The patients with synchronous ESCCs had significantly poorer survival than those with HNSCC alone (5-year overall survival: 30% vs. 70%; log-rank P < 0.001). However, patients with HPV-positive HNSCC tend to have favorable outcome than those with HPV-negative HNSCC.Conclusions:HPV infection plays little role in field cancerization phenomenon to initiate synchronous SCC. The synchronous HNSCC and ESCC from the same patients had no clonal relationship. Routine endoscopic examination of the esophagus should be recommended for patients with risk factors identified.Levels of evidence:NA.

Recent advances in fieldcancerizationand management of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.,"Sean R Christensen, Sean R Christensen","Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is among the most common cancers in humans, and many patients with SCC will develop multiple tumors within their lifetime. The field cancerization concept, originally proposed over 60 years ago, hypothesized that multiple primary cancers may arise simultaneously and coexist with subclinical precursor lesions within a defined field. Genetic sequencing of SCC and precursor lesions has identified what may be the earliest clonal proliferations in SCC development and confirmed that field cancerization in the skin is mediated by ultraviolet radiation. For patients with multiple SCCs and severe actinic damage, treatment of precursor lesions within a cancerized field can decrease the risk of subsequent cancer development. Sunblock is an effective intervention for field cancerization, even in patients with established disease. There is now direct evidence that field therapy with topical 5-fluorouracil is effective in reducing the incidence of subsequent SCC, and there is indirect evidence suggesting that topical imiquimod, topical ingenol mebutate, and photodynamic therapy are similarly effective. There is limited direct evidence to show that systemic acitretin or nicotinamide can decrease incident SCC in patients with field cancerization. In this review, an approach to the management of patients with multiple SCCs and field cancerization is presented along with the rationale to support field-directed therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//29904586/,2016
Angiotensin-converting enzyme and its association with outcome in lungcancer.,"F K Rømer, F K Rømer","Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) in 141 patients with newly detected primary lung cincer was 22.1 +/- 6.1 nmol/ml/min (mean +/- s.d.); lower than in healthy controls (24.4 +/- 6.2 nmol/ml/min, P less than 0.02). No correlation was found between SACE and sex, age, site of cancer, histological type, or lung function. After subdivision of the patients according to increasing SACE levels: less than 16.0 (mean SACE of lung cancer--s.d.), 16.0-22.0, 22.1-28.2 and greater than 28.2 nmol/ml/min (mean SACE of lung cancer + s.d.) there was a strong association (P less than 0.001) between SACE level and the proportion of patients who were radically operated without relapse during 8-22 months follow-up. None of 23 patients within the lowest SACE range were cured, even though 7 were referred for operation after preoperative examination. In contrast, 10/25 patients (40%) within the highest SACE range were cured. The results suggest that low SACE is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer, even in patients who are judged as being operable on preoperative evaluation; and measurement of preoperative SACE in lug cancer may be a useful prognostic indicator in this disorder.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//6258623/,2023
Actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma: clinical and pathological features.,"A Filosa, G Filosa, A Filosa, G Filosa","Actinic keratoses (AKs) are the most common keratinocytederived precancerous lesion in humans; they can be observed predominantly in fair-skinned individuals on sun-exposed surfaces. The primary risk factor for AKs is cumulative UV exposure from sunlight and/or tanning salons. AKs may present on a patient as a few detectable lesions. In addition to these, there are subclinical (invisible) AKs that are estimated to occur up to 10 times more often than visible AKs, since unprotected skin receives UV radiation from the sun. Clinical and subclinical AK lesions occurring in photo-damaged skin are called field cancerization. A field of change can be up to 7 cm around the primary lesions, resulting in lesions that are genetically similar. AKs are defined at the histologic level by dysplasia and consist of keratinocytes manifesting atypical nuclei that are enlarged, irregular, and hyperchromatic. The histopathologic changes noted in keratinocytic proliferative lesions involve disturbance of normal surface maturation. The degree and extent of keratinocytic atypia vary in these lesions. The atypical keratinocytes show enlarged nuclei with hyperchromasia, dyskeratosis and mitoses in any layer of the epidermis. In lesions of epidermal dysplasias, surface keratinocytic maturation is present, and a granular cell layer is usually noted. In intraepidermal carcinomas, there is full-thickness involvement of the epidermis by the atypical keratinocytes. While molecular techniques have improved our ability to distinguish squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from AKs, they have also reinforced the concept that non-melanoma skin cancers arise through a complex series of aberrations at the molecular level. AKs represent a spectrum along the continuum to invasive cancer. They are the most visible manifestation of field cancerization which creates a population of atypical cells with the potential to progress to invasive malignancy capable of metastasis. As the perilesional epithelium also has abnormalities due to photo exposure, understanding the existence of a ""cancerization field"" should be explained to the patients, reinforcing the importance of preventive clinical follow-up. The aim of the present review was to emphasize the histopathological aspect of the morphological spectrum in AK, and SCCs, also elucidating the clinicopathology of field canceriziation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//26099352/,2022
Narrow band imaging in the intra-operative definition of resection margins in oral cavity and oropharyngealcancer.,"Giancarlo Tirelli, Marco Piovesana, Annalisa Gatto, Margherita Tofanelli, Matteo Biasotto, Francesca Boscolo Nata, Giancarlo Tirelli, Marco Piovesana, Annalisa Gatto, Margherita Tofanelli, Matteo Biasotto, Francesca Boscolo Nata","Objectives:In oncological surgery, a three-dimensional resection 1.5-2 cm from the gross tumour edge is currently considered appropriate, and the status of resection margins is the most reliable indicator of radicality. Awareness of ""field cancerization"" calls for a re-evaluation of the benchmarks of tumour resection; however, its identification is not simple because the dysplastic areas may be far from the main lesion and difficult to recognize macroscopically. New technologies such as narrow band imaging (NBI) could improve the detection of neoplastic and pre-neoplastic areas, ensuring more precise resections. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the value of NBI in detecting pre-cancerous areas and/or cancer around the tumour bulk intra-operatively, to achieve adequate resection of the tumour.Materials and methods:The resection margins of 8 oral cavity and 8 oropharyngeal cancers were first drawn by macroscopic evaluation and then re-defined using NBI. Resections were performed following the NBI-drawing if extemporaneous histological examinations of the NBI-defined enlargements were positive for dysplasia or cancer. The number of clear margins was evaluated.Results:Resections margins were free of tumour or dysplasia at extemporaneous examination; on definitive histology, two patients had a margin positive for cancer and dysplasia, respectively. Among the NBI-defined enlargements, 25% were positive for dysplasia and 75% for cancer. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 88.9%, 100% and 87.5%, respectively.Conclusion:The method we propose could be useful for obtaining free surgical margins and reducing the potential development of tumour foci resulting from incomplete resection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//26216339/,2022

Although resection palliates some patients who do not live that long, 50% of patients so treated are not helped at all. Until ignorance of a cancer's real stage is resolved by improved techniques, the evaluation and choice of therapy can be based only upon knowledge of the natural history of untreated metastases and determinants of prognosis derived from treated patients. Analysis of the survival rates of 252 patients who had biopsy proven, unresected hepatic metastases that were the only evidence of residual disease shows the extent to which natural history, rather than resection, may determine length of survival-- and indicates the need for critical analysis of 2- and 3-year survival rates reported after any therapy.

"Gene expression subtraction of non-cancerouslung from smokers and non-smokers with adenocarcinoma, as a predictor for smokers developing lungcancer.","David Stav, Ilan Bar, Judith Sandbank, David Stav, Ilan Bar, Judith Sandbank","Background:Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death in developed countries. Adenocarcinoma is becoming the most common form of lung cancer. Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for lung cancer. Long-term cigarettes smoking may be characterized by genetic alteration and diffuse injury of the airways surface, named field cancerization, while cancer in non-smokers is usually clonally derived. Detecting specific genes expression changes in non-cancerous lung in smokers with adenocarcinoma may give us instrument for predicting smokers who are going to develop this malignancy.Objectives:We described the gene expression in non-cancerous lungs from 21 smoker patients with lung adenocarcinoma and compare it to gene expression in non-cancerous lung tissue from 10 non-smokers with primary lung adenocarcinoma.Methods:Total RNA was isolated from peripheral non-cancerous lung tissue. The cDNA was hybridized to the U133A GeneChip array. Hierarchical clustering analysis on genes obtained from smokers and non-smokers, after subtracting were exported to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software for further analysis.Results:The genes subtraction resulted in disclosure of 36 genes with high score. They were subsequently mapped and sorted based on location, cellular components, and biochemical activity. The gene functional analysis disclosed 20 genes, which are involved in cancer process (P = 7.05E-5 to 2.92E-2).Conclusion:Detected genes may serve as a predictor for smokers who may be at high risk of developing lung cancer.

The mechanistic understanding of the pathways involved in tumor transformation has implicated a priori predominance of epigenetic perturbations and a posteriori genetic instability. In this work, we aimed to explain the mechanistic involvement of epigenetic pathways in the cancer process, as well as the abilities of natural bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and ketones) to specifically target the epigenome of tumor cells. The molecular events leading to transformation, angiogenesis, and dissemination are often complex, stochastic, and take turns. On the other hand, the decisive advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have allowed, in recent years, for the mechanistic decryption of the molecular pathways of the cancerization process. This could explain the possibility of specifically targeting this or that mechanism leading to cancerization. With the plasticity and flexibility of epigenetic modifications, some studies have started the pharmacological screening of natural substances against different epigenetic pathways (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, and chromatin remodeling) to restore the cellular memory lost during tumor transformation. These substances can inhibit DNMTs, modify chromatin remodeling, and adjust histone modifications in favor of pre-established cell identity by the differentiation program. Epidrugs are molecules that target the epigenome program and can therefore restore cell memory in cancerous diseases. Natural products isolated from medicinal plants such as flavonoids and phenolic acids have shown their ability to exhibit several actions on epigenetic modifiers, such as the inhibition of DNMT, HMT, and HAT. The mechanisms of these substances are specific and pleiotropic and can sometimes be stochastic, and their use as anticancer epidrugs is currently a remarkable avenue in the fight against human cancers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//35327559/,2019

In this narrative review, we describe the fundamental and clinical significance of the bystander effect with respect to cell-to-cell interactions in carcinogenesis, therapeutic response, and tissue regeneration. In carcinogenesis, the bystander effect mediates communications between tumor microenvironments and non-malignant epithelial cells and has been suggested to impact heterogeneous tumorigenic cells in tumors and cancerized fields. In therapeutic response, the bystander effect mediates communications between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells and may transmit both drug efficacy and resistance. Therefore, control of therapeutic response transmission via the bystander effect might offer a promising future cancer treatment. Finally, in tissue regeneration, circulating cells and stromal cells may differentiate into various cells for the purpose of tissue regeneration under direction of the bystander effect arising from surrounding cells in a defective space.

The early genetic events might lead to clonal expansion of pre-neoplastic daughter cells in a particular tumor field. Subsequent genomic changes in some of these cells drive them towards the malignant phenotype. These transformed cells are diagnosed histopathologically as cancers owing to changes in cell morphology. Conceivably, a population of daughter cells with early genetic changes (without histopathology) remains in the organ, demonstrating the concept of field cancerization.

Despite hints that axon guidance factor semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) may function as a tumor inhibitor, its clinical importance and therapeutic potential have not yet been explored. The present study investigated the role of SEMA3A and its receptors-plexins A1-A4 (PLXNA1-A4) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1)-in pancreatic cancer. QRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses revealed overexpression of SEMA3A, NRP1 and PLXNA1 in metaplastic ducts, malignant cells and nerves of cancerous specimens, and showed that elevated levels of corresponding mRNA (6.8-fold, 2.0-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively) clearly correlated with negative clinicopathological manifestations such as shorter survival (SEMA3A and PLXNA1) and a lesser degree of tumor differentiation (NRP1) in Stages I-III patients. High SEMA3A expression in pancreata of Stage IV M1 patients and in peritoneal metastases, and consequent functional studies indicated that poor clinical outcome might be related to the ability of SEMA3A to promote dissemination and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells through activation of multiple pathways involving Rac1, GSK3b or p42/p44 MAPK, but not E- to N-cadherin switch, MMP-9 or VEGF induction. Thus, this study is the first to quantify expression of the SEMA3A system in human malignancy and to show that overexpression of SEMA3A by nerves and transformed cells leads to a SEMA3A-rich environment which may favor malignant activities of tumor cells. Furthermore, negative clinicopathological correlations suggest that SEMA3A might represent a novel intervention target but not a treatment option for pancreatic cancer patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17631638/,2019

Looking at the statistics proves that progress in cancer therapy is always beyond cancer in a race of pessimism about the future; for various kinds of cancers yearly cause death in the world, whereas the conventional and even modern therapies often exhibit lack of reliability in the treatment of cancer. In principle, various reasons are identified for cancer resistance and recurrence. Recognizing the cells/tissue from which cancer takes origin enables its early detection, and optimistically saying, protection of patients against death. It has been recognized that cancer stem cells are responsible for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Conventional therapies cannot eradicate the cancer stem cell; therefore, cancer recurrence is unavoidable. In this regards, designing smart platforms with specific properties is an essential step in cancer treatment. Theranostic platforms have facilitated the cancer diagnosis and treatment, simultaneously. In this respect, several types of smart materials have been designed to detect and cure cancer. Cancer stem cell as a root of the cancerous tumor should be eradicated to achieve the complete treatment; hence, cancer stem cell mechanism must be known precisely to design an appropriate platform making possible to encounter with cancer stem cell. In this review paper, various therapeutic and diagnostic techniques of cancerous stem cell are discussed to pave a way for designing proper platforms for cancer eradication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//30280678/,2021
Progress and potential of RAS mutation detection for diagnostics and companion diagnostics.,"Ian A Cree, Ian A Cree","The importance of RAS mutation in carcinogenesis is established, and knowledge of an individual cancer's mutation status is important for optimal treatment. Areas covered: This paper is restricted to RAS testing in cancer, and highlights papers relevant to current practice. Expert commentary: Multiple laboratory methods are available for RAS gene analysis. PCR is commonly used to determine RAS status, providing a robust and inexpensive technology for clinical use. Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are changing the way in which mutation status is determined, though they require considerable expertise. Pre-analytical issues affect both methods and should be considered. The interpretation and reporting of results is not simple, particularly for NGS. External quality assurance is a pre-requisite for success, and is mandated by most laboratory accreditation schemes. The use of RAS testing is now extending beyond biopsy material to include the detection of mutations in circulating cell-free DNA and tumour cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//27494709/,2023
Exact analytical solution of the peristaltic nanofluids flow in an asymmetric channel with flexible walls and slip condition: application to thecancertreatment.,"Abdelhalim Ebaid, Emad H Aly, Abdelhalim Ebaid, Emad H Aly","In the cancer treatment, magnetic nanoparticles are injected into the blood vessel nearest to the cancer's tissues. The dynamic of these nanoparticles occurs under the action of the peristaltic waves generated on the flexible walls of the blood vessel. Studying such nanofluid flow under this action is therefore useful in treating tissues of the cancer. In this paper, the mathematical model describing the slip peristaltic flow of nanofluid was analytically investigated. Exact expressions were deduced for the temperature distribution and nano-particle concentration. In addition, the effects of the slip, thermophoresis, and Brownian motion parameters on the temperature and nano-particle concentration profiles were discussed and further compared with other approximate results in the literatures. In particular, these results have been obtained at the same values of the physical examined parameters that was considered in Akbar et al., ""Peristaltic flow of a nanofluid with slip effects,"" 2012. The results reveal that remarkable differences are detected between the exact current results and those approximately obtained in the literatures for behaviour of the temperature profile and nano-particles concentration. Accordingly, the current analysis and results are considered as optimal and therefore may be taken as a base for any future comparisons.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24151526/,2023
Mechanism and its regulation of tumor-induced angiogenesis.,"Manoj Kumar Gupta, Ren-Yi Qin, Manoj Kumar Gupta, Ren-Yi Qin","Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrates into cancerous growths, supplying nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. The process of angiogenesis plays an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions. Solid tumors depend on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis in a hostile environment. In the prevascular phase, the tumor is rarely larger than 2 to 3 mm(3) and may contain a million or more cells. Up to this size, tumor cells can obtain the necessary oxygen and nutrient supplies required for growth and survival by simple passive diffusion. The properties of tumors to release and induce several angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors which play crucial roles in regulating endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, apoptosis or survival, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion through different intracellular signaling are thought to be the essential mechanisms during tumor-induced angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis actually starts with tumor cells releasing molecules that send signals to surrounding normal host tissue. This signaling activates certain genes in the host tissue that, in turn, make proteins to encourage growth of new blood vessels. In this review, we focus the mechanisms of tumor-induced angiogenesis, with an emphasis on the regulatory role of several angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents during the angiogenic process in tumors. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis have led to the development of several most effective anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic therapeutic agents and also have provided several techniques for the regulation of cancer's angiogenic switch. The suggestion is made that standard cytotoxic chemotherapy and angiogenesis inhibitors used in combination may produce complementary therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//12800214/,2020
Is carcinogenesis a form of speciation?,"Peter Duesberg, Daniele Mandrioli, Amanda McCormack, Joshua M Nicholson, Peter Duesberg, Daniele Mandrioli, Amanda McCormack, Joshua M Nicholson","Since cancers have individual clonal karyotypes, are immortal and evolve from normal cells treated by carcinogens only after exceedingly long latencies of many months to decades-we deduce that carcinogenesis may be a form of speciation. This theory proposes that carcinogens initiate carcinogenesis by causing aneuploidy, i.e., losses or gains of chromosomes. Aneuploidy destabilizes the karyotype, because it unbalances thousands of collaborating genes including those that synthesize, segregate and repair chromosomes. Driven by this inherent instability aneuploid cells evolve ever-more random karyotypes automatically. Most of these perish, but a very small minority acquires reproductive autonomy-the primary characteristic of cancer cells and species. Selection for autonomy stabilizes new cancer species against the inherent instability of aneuploidy within specific margins of variation. The speciation theory explains five common characteristics of cancers: (1) species-specific autonomy; (2) karyotypic and phenotypic individuality; (3) flexibility by karyotypic variations within stable margins of autonomy; (4) immortality by replacing defective karyotypes from constitutive pools of competent variants or subspecies generated by this flexibility; and (5) long neoplastic latencies by the low probability that random karyotypic alterations generate new autonomous species. Moreover, the theory explains phylogenetic relations between cancers of the same tissue, because carcinogenesis is restricted by tissue-specific transcriptomes. The theory also solves paradoxes of other cancer theories. For example, ""aneuploidy"" of cancers is now said to be a ""paradox"" or ""cancer's fatal flaw,"" because aneuploidy impairs normal growth and development. But if the ""aneuploidies"" of cancers are in effect the karyotypes of new species, this paradox is solved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//21666415/,2021

In contrast to adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's esophagus in Western countries, the major disease phenotype in the Asia-Pacific region is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which is attributed to the prevalence of smoking, alcohol, and betel quid chewing. Despite a multidisciplinary approach to treating esophageal cancer, the outcome remains poor. Moreover, field cancerization reveals that esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is closely linked with the development of head and neck cancers that further sub-optimize the treatment of patients. Therefore, preventive strategies are of paramount importance to improve the prognosis of this dismal disease. Since obstacles exist for primary prevention via risk factor elimination, the current rationale for esophageal cancer prevention is to identify high-risk groups at earlier stages of the disease, and encourage them to get a confirmatory diagnosis, prompt treatment, and intensive surveillance for secondary prevention. Novel biomarkers for identifying specific at-risk populations are under extensive investigation. Advances in image-enhanced endoscopy do not just substantially improve our ability to identify small precancerous or cancerous foci, but can also accurately predict their invasiveness. Research input from the basic sciences should be translated into preventive measures in order to decrease the disease burden of esophageal cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//20610142/,2018

Recent molecular genetic studies of histologically normal and premalignant epithelia of high-risk subjects and studies of malignant tumors in aerodigestive tract epithelia have identified a continuum of accumulated specific genetic alterations that possibly occur during the clonal evolution of tumors, namely, during the multistep process. Second primary or multiple primary tumors arise in the same fields as independent clones, with similar but unique molecular genetic and/or cellular alterations. Consequently, the assessment of these genetic and phenotypic alterations has been integrated into clinical chemoprevention trials in an effort to identify biomarkers that are also risk predictors and intermediate end points. This review covers candidate biomarkers of the processes of field cancerization and multistep tumor development in aerodigestive tract epithelia, including general and specific genetic markers, proliferation markers, and squamous differentiation markers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8842479/,2016
RREB1 promotes the development of parafollicular carcinogenesis through the Ras-Raf-1-ELK3 signaling pathway.,"Shihong Ma, Hui Wang, Wanling Li, Zhe Yan, Xuanming Luo, Pinxiang Lu, Shihong Ma, Hui Wang, Wanling Li, Zhe Yan, Xuanming Luo, Pinxiang Lu","Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is derived from parathyroid follicle cells (C cells) secrete calcitonin, accounting for approximately 5-10% of all thyroid cancers. The malignancy is between differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer and undifferentiated thyroid cancer and has a relatively poor prognosis. In MTC tumor cells, RREB1 regulates the differentiation of parathyroid cells via RAS-Raf-1-ELK3 signaling and induce calcitonin secretion. Therefore, it is easy to induce parathyroid parafollicular cells canceration and medullary thyroid carcinoma. Here, we investigated the correlation between RREB1, RAS-Raf-1-ELK3 signaling pathway and medullary thyroid carcinoma with various phases.

[Current state and future perspectives of oncology care in Hungary based on epidemiologic data].,"Miklós Kásler, Miklós Kásler","The cancer mortality and morbidity data over the period of 1999-2003 in Hungary has been analyzed. The attempts for the harmonization of cancer care's organization between European Cancer Centers and Hungarian Cancer Centers will also be reviewed. Total cancer mortality of Hungary was found to be 33 530 persons in 2003. According to the cancer mortality data of 36 European countries the highest mortality rate were in Hungary for male in 1999. Hungary had the second place in the female cancer mortality in Europe. It has also been found that the Hungarian men had the highest rate tobacco related cancers (lung, oral cancers) in Europe. The trends of the cancer mortality for women is changed during the period 1999-2003. In 1999 breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer's death for women followed by colorectal and lung cancers. The lung cancer rates have been rising in Hungarian women and became the main cause of cancer death in 2002. The unfavorable cancer mortality trends in Hungary might be attributed to the high consumption of tobacco and alcohol, moreover the unsatisfactory care of cancer patients. The cancer mortality in Hungary could be reduced by the improvement of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. The European accreditation of the cancer control activities should be based on the network of Cancer Centers in Hungary.

This study examines adult cancer patients' views about music's role before and after diagnosis.Methods:Constructivist approach, with grounded theory informed design using convenience, snowball and theoretical sampling. Patients from Australian metropolitan cancer and hospice settings completed demographic questionnaires and participated in semi-structured interviews. Qualitative inter-rater reliability was applied.Results:Fifty-two patients reported comparable time spent experiencing music pre-post diagnosis. Music may remain incidental; however, many patients adapt music usage to ameliorate cancer's aversive effects. Patients often draw from their musical lives and explore unfamiliar music to: remain connected with pre-illness identities; strengthen capacity for enduring treatment, ongoing survival (even when knowing ""you're going to die""), or facing death; reframe upended worlds; and live enriched lives. Patients can ascribe human or physical properties to music when describing its transformative effects. Familiar lyrics maybe reinterpreted, and patients' intensified emotional reactions to music can reflect their threatened mortality. Sometimes music becomes inaccessible, elusive, and/or intensifies distress and is avoided. Families', friends' and professionals' recognition of patients' altered musical lives and music-based suggestions can extend patients' use of music for self-care.Conclusion:Health professionals can support patients by inquiring about their music behaviours and recognising that altered music usage may signify vulnerability. Although commonly recommended, hospital concerts and music broadcasts need sensitive delivery. Patients' preferred music should be available in diagnostic, treatment and palliative settings because it can promote endurance and life enrichment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24287507/,2016

A genetic explanation of Slaughter's concept of fieldcancerization: evidence and clinical implications.,"Boudewijn J M Braakhuis, Maarten P Tabor, J Alain Kummer, C René Leemans, Ruud H Brakenhoff, Boudewijn J M Braakhuis, Maarten P Tabor, J Alain Kummer, C René Leemans, Ruud H Brakenhoff","The concept of ""field cancerization"" was first introduced by Slaughter et al. [D. P, Slaughter et al., Cancer (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] in 1953 when studying the presence of histologically abnormal tissue surrounding oral squamous cell carcinoma. It was proposed to explain the development of multiple primary tumors and locally recurrent cancer. Organ systems in which field cancerization has been described since then are: head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx), lung, vulva, esophagus, cervix, breast, skin, colon, and bladder. Recent molecular findings support the carcinogenesis model in which the development of a field with genetically altered cells plays a central role. In the initial phase, a stem cell acquires genetic alterations and forms a ""patch,"" a clonal unit of altered daughter cells. These patches can be recognized on the basis of mutations in TP53, and have been reported for head and neck, lung, skin, and breast cancer. The conversion of a patch into an expanding field is the next logical and critical step in epithelial carcinogenesis. Additional genetic alterations are required for this step, and by virtue of its growth advantage, a proliferating field gradually displaces the normal mucosa. In the mucosa of the head and neck, as well as the esophagus, such fields have been detected with dimensions of >7 cm in diameter, whereas they are usually not detected by routine diagnostic techniques. Ultimately, clonal divergence leads to the development of one or more tumors within a contiguous field of preneoplastic cells. An important clinical implication is that fields often remain after surgery of the primary tumor and may lead to new cancers, designated presently by clinicians as ""a second primary tumor"" or ""local recurrence,"" depending on the exact site and time interval. In conclusion, the development of an expanding preneoplastic field appears to be a critical step in epithelial carcinogenesis with important clinical consequences. Diagnosis and treatment of epithelial cancers should not only be focused on the tumor but also on the field from which it developed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//12702551/,2018

The multiplicity of the lesions and the extent of the area influence the treatment decision. Providing at least equivalent efficacy and tolerability, field directed therapies are therefore often more worthwhile than lesion targeted approaches.

Seventy-five malignant colorectal tumors were discovered in the latter group, a positive rate of 37.69 per 100,000 (seven were colonic cancers, 14 rectal cancers, 20 polyps with cancerous change, and 34 carcinoids). Of this group, 2701 had various types of polyps and 5242 had definitive diagnostic schistosomiasis. History, physical examination, and an occult blood test are simple, useful methods for detecting late colorectal cancer but are of no value in preventive screening of early cases. While digital rectal examination is an important, effective method of diagnosing rectal cancer, the positive rate is one tenth that of rectoscopy. It cannot be used for mass screening because the examining finger cannot tolerate such constant use and is too short to discover higher tumors. The sequence of colorectal cancerous change found in our center was from normal intestinal epithelium to tumorigenic polyps or colorectal ulcer, to polyps with anaplastic change, to polyps with local cancerous change, to adenocarcinoma.

The concomitant changes in the tumor microenvironment have drawn more attention recently. Could the changes in the tumor microenvironment and the epithelial field cancerization concepts be linked? In view of the importance of stroma in the development of epithelium and evidence in carcinoma-associated stroma, we propose the question if stroma not only reciprocates the neoplastic changes of the epithelia, but also contributes to field cancerization. Actually one perspective paper pointed out that healing wound can influence the recurrence of field cancerization. In another words, the microenvironment of healing wound determines the prognosis of field cancerization.

The positive expression of the MG7-corresponding antigen (MG7-Ag) was 100%, 100%, and 60.0% respectively in villous, mixed and tubular polyps. A close correlation was shown between dysplasia of grade II and the positive expression of MG7-Ag (p < 0.05). The positive expression was significantly related to canceration (P < 0.025). No malignancy was found in 45 patients with negative expression. But 12 of 67 patients with positive expression developed cancers in 3 to 38 months.

Super competition as a possible mechanism to pioneer precancerous fields.,"Christa Rhiner, Eduardo Moreno, Christa Rhiner, Eduardo Moreno","Cancer is the result of sequential genetic changes over time that transform a cell into a malignant and ultimately invasive entity. The insight that cancerous cells arise from a series of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors, commonly known as multistep carcinogenesis, has been conceptually elaborated and proven in the last 20 years. Although knowledge about late steps of cancerogenesis and disease progression has greatly advanced, the initial molecular events remain largely unknown. Basic research in Drosophila has started the quest to find early markers that detect initial clonal expansion of precancerous cells. These efforts were spurred by novel findings demonstrating that certain mutations transform cells into super-competitors that expand at the expense of the surrounding epithelial cells without inducing histological changes. This mechanism, discovered as super competition in the fly, might also lie at the heart of a clinical observation termed 'field cancerization'. This review aims to bring together current understanding from basic research on cell competition and clinical studies that have analyzed field characteristics to highlight parallels and possible connections.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19126656/,2020

Patients suffering from head and neck cancer (HNC) have or develop a second esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) or bronchial cancer (BC) in 5-14% of cases. When a second esophageal cancer occurs in a patient with HNC, the prognosis is generally determined by the ESCC, and, unfortunately, it is poor. Screening and surveillance by Lugol chromoesophagoscopy enable early detection and curative treatment of second esophageal neoplasias. Surveillance appears to result in a survival benefit for HNC patients. Vice versa, patients with ESCC or BC have a risk of about 10% for developing HNC. Periodic pharyngolaryngoscopy is recommended for curatively treated ESCC or BC patients.

Gene mutation analysis of oral submucous fibrosiscancerizationin Hainan Island.,"Bingxia Li, Xinyu Chen, Haiyu Xian, Qitao Wen, Tao Wang, Bingxia Li, Xinyu Chen, Haiyu Xian, Qitao Wen, Tao Wang","Objective:The sequencing panel composed of 61 target genes was used to explore the related mutation genes of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) cancerization, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the early diagnosis of oral submucous fibrosis cancerization, find the most important mutations in OSF cancerization, and more targeted prevention of OSF cancerization.Methods:A total of 74 clinically diagnosed samples were included, including 36 cases of OSCC and 38 cases of OSF cancer patients. DNA was extracted, and targeted gene panel sequencing technology was used to analyze the gene frequency of pathogenic mutation sites in clinical samples.Results:Gene panel sequencing analysis showed that there were 69 mutations in 18 genes in OSCC and OSF cancerous specimens. The results of gene panel sequencing were screened, and 18 mutant genes were finally screened out and their mutation frequencies in the samples were analyzed. According to the frequency of gene mutations from high to low, they were TP53, FLT4, PIK3CA, CDKN2A, FGFR4, HRAS, BRCA1, PTPN11, NF1, KMT2A, RB1, PTEN, MSH2, MLH1, KMT2D, FLCN, BRCA2, APC. The mutation frequency of FLT4 gene was significantly higher than that of OSCC group (P< 0.05).Conclusion:FLT4 gene may be related to OSF cancerization and is expected to be an early diagnostic biomarker for OSF cancerization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//38050610/,2021

The glutathione cycle is the creative reaction of life andcancer.Cancercauses oncogenes and not vice versa.,"J A Holt, J A Holt","Life is definable as a chemical reaction which obeys exponential growth and dies if reversed. Such a reaction must be the commencement of all life so that every evolved form of it inherits these characteristics. As no single reaction known has these two features, life must be a combination of two or more reactions which whilst obeying all the classical laws of physics and chemistry assume an exponential form and effectively act as being irreversible. The reactions of glutathione--oxidation and reduction--when combined in sequence as a cyclical process fulfill these criteria. The cyclic changes of glutathione from reduced to oxidised to reduced forms must therefore be the reaction which creates life and is responsible for cancer's growth. 434 mHz electromagnetic radiation stimulates cancer growth rate by forcing this cycle into activity. Proof of this hypothesis is the long-term control of cancer in 11 patients treated with oxidised glutathione and 434 mHz radiation. Genetic material does not contain any energy system with exponential form, neither is it self-replicating. Genetic material will only reproduce if placed within an immortal cell in which all controls of the glutathione system have been lost, as in a cancer cell. Oncogenes must be the product of cancer and not the reverse.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8350775/,2022

Epigenetic alterations are frequently present in chronic inflammation-exposed tissues, but information on individual genes involved in the formation of a field defect is still fragmental. Here, using non-cancerous gastric tissues of cancer patients, we isolated 16 aberrantly methylated genes, and identified chromatin remodelers ACTL6B and SMARCA1 as novel genes frequently methylated in non-cancerous tissues. SMARCA1 was expressed at high levels in normal gastric tissues, but was frequently silenced by aberrant methylation in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, somatic mutations of additional chromatin remodelers, such as ARID1A, SMARCA2, and SMARCA4, were found in 30% of gastric cancers. Mutant allele frequency suggested that the majority of cancer cells harbored a mutation when present. Depletion of a chromatin remodeler, SMARCA1 or SMARCA2, in cancer cell lines promoted their growth. These results showed that epigenetic and genetic alterations of chromatin remodelers are induced at an early stage of carcinogenesis and are frequently involved in the formation of a field defect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25462860/,2020

Since the majority of cancers originate in the epithelial layer, probing the morphological and pathological changes in the superficial tissues using an expended parameter set with improved contrast will assist in early clinical detection of cancers. We carry out Mueller matrix imaging on different cancerous tissues to look for cancer specific features. Using proper scattering models and Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the relationship between the microstructures of the samples, which are represented by the parameters of the scattering model and the characteristic features of the Mueller matrix.

Here we address whether this concept should be extended also to patients affected by oral lichen planus (OLP), an inflammatory disorder associated with an increased risk of cancer development.Methods:Data from a cohort of 45 patients with OLP who subsequently developed severe dysplastic changes and/or oral squamous cell carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who presented more than one oral neoplastic event were considered for further data analysis as regards incidence, localization, management and prognosis.Results:Twenty (44.4%) patients were affected by one single neoplastic event while 25 (55.6%) developed multiple and often multifocal oral dysplastic and/or malignant events. In most cases, a careful surveillance programme led to diagnosis and effective treatment of oral neoplasias at an early intraepithelial and microinvasive stage, leading to long-term survival. In some patients, however, additional primary tumours occurred suddenly with rapid invasion, leading to advanced stage diagnosis and poor prognosis. Overall, three patients (12%) died due to malignant oral disease.Conclusions:Patients with OLP and subsequent development of dysplasia/ oral squamous cell carcinoma are at risk of having multiple and multifocal neoplastic events of the oral cavity, a phenomenon which parallels the concept of field cancerization of traditional head and neck cancers. If detected at an early stage, these neoplasias can be managed with superficial and complete resection.

The widespread application of the next-generation sequencing technologies in cancer genomics research provides novel insights into determining the clonal relationship between multiple tumours within the same thyroid gland. For eight MPTC patients, we performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted region sequencing to identify the non-synonymous point mutations and gene rearrangements of distinct and spatially separated tumour foci. Among these eight MPTCs, completely discordant mutational spectra were observed in the distinct cancerous nodules of patients MPTC1 and 5, suggesting that these nodules originated from independent precursors. In another three cases (MPTC2, 6, and 8), the distinct MPTC foci of these patients had no other shared mutations except BRAF V600E, also indicating likely independent origins. Two patients (MPTC3 and 4) shared almost identical mutational spectra amongst their separate tumour nodules, suggesting a common clonal origin. MPTC patient 7 had seven cancer foci, of which two foci shared 66.7% of mutations, while the remaining cancer foci displayed no common non-synonymous mutations, indicating that MPTC7 has multiple independent origins accompanied by intraglandular disease dissemination. In this study, we found that 75% of MPTC cases arose as independent tumours, which supports the field cancerization hypothesis describing multiple malignant lesions. MPTC may also arise from intrathyroidal metastases from a single malignant clone, as well as multiple independent origins accompanied by intrathyroidal metastasis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//27071483/,2022

Treatment consists in complete cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Recurrence rates are disappointingly high, as 60% of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer considered in remission will develop recurrent disease within five years. Special attention to undetected peritoneal metastasis and residual tumorous cells during surgery is necessary as they are the main predictors of recurrences. Targeted therapies aim to bring chemotherapy, radiotherapy and selective tumor photosensitizer (PS) agents to the targeted cell and its tumoral microenvironment. Folate receptor α (FRα) shows promising prospects in targeting ovarian cancerous cells. Indeed, with good specificity and frequent overexpression in ovarian cancer, FRα is a recurrent topic in recent publications. The aim of this review is to present FRα and the reasons that make it an ideal targeting ligand for ovarian carcinoma therapy.

This effect was proposed by Slaughter in order to explain the development of multiple primary tumors and locally recurrent cancer. The particular changes associated with this effect, in each type of cancer, have been detected even at distances greater than 10cm off the tumor, in areas classified as normal by histopathological studies. Early detection of lung, colon, and ovary cancer has been reported by the use of Partial Wave Microscopy Spectroscopy (PWS) and has been explained in terms of the field cancerization effect. Until now, field cancerization has been studied as a field effect and we hypothesize that it can be understood as an amplifying effect of biochemical abnormalities in cells, which leads us to ask the question: Could field cancerization be interpreted as a biochemical anomaly amplification due to transformed cells? We propose this question because the biochemical changes due to field cancerization alter the dynamics of molecules and cells in abnormal tissues in comparison to normal ones, these alterations modify the interaction of intracellular and extracellular medium, as well as cellular movement.

It has been proposed that paxillin is involved in certain malignancies as an oncogene. Additionally, several investigations have assessed paxillin expression and investigated its function in developing distinct human carcinomas, including squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, it was discovered that there is a strong link between paxillin levels and cancer progression and spread.Objective:This investigation was carried out to analyze and compare the salivary paxillin levels between oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), OSCC and the healthy controls to assess its potential role as a biomarker of oral cancer aiming for early diagnosis and better prognosis of OSCC.Methods:Forty-five patients, ranging in age from thirty to seventy-five, were divided into three groups: fifteen patients with OPMDs, fifteen patients with OSCC, and fifteen controls. Paxillin was identified in saliva samples by using an ELISA kit.Results:Patients with OSCC and OPMDs have considerably greater salivary Paxillin levels than the healthy control group. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used in our study to distinguish patients with OPMDs from those with OSCC. The ROC curve constructed with the OPMDs group as the positives had lower sensitivity and area under the curve (AUC) values [100% and 1] than the ROC curve with the malignant group as the positives [93.3% and 0.997], respectively. Furthermore, ROC analysis performed between OPMDs group and the malignant group showed a specificity of 73.3% and a cut-off value ≥ 7.9 .Conclusion:Paxillin can be considered a reliable biomarker for identifying and comparing OPMDs and OSCC cancerous changes.Gov identifier:NCT06154551- 4/12/2023.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//39048985/,2017

The best example is monitoring of cirrhotic patients by ultrasonography and determination of alpha-feto-protein every 6 months which has proved effective in reducing mortality due to primary liver cancer. The monitoring of certain populations of patients with many naevi or a history of melanoma also allows early diagnosis and effective melanoma price, however, the excision of many non-cancerous lesions. Some cancers did not follow this rule because, for instance, the screening and early diagnosis of lung cancer among smokers is still a failure even when using the scanner.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//20225562/,2021
Stiffness mapping prostate biopsy samples using a tactile sensor.,"Qiyu Peng, Sadao Omata, Donna M Peehl, Chris E Constantinou, Qiyu Peng, Sadao Omata, Donna M Peehl, Chris E Constantinou","Previous studies have demonstrated that the stiffness of cancerous cells reflects their pathological stage and progression rates, with increased cancerous cell stiffness associated with increased aggressiveness. Therefore, the elasticity of the cancerous cells has the potential to be used as an indicator of the cancer's aggressiveness. However, the sensitivity and resolution of current palpation and imaging techniques are not sufficient to detect small cancerous tissues. In previous studies, we developed a tactile-based device to map with high resolution the stiffness of a tissue section. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this device using different tissues (BPH, Cancer and PZ) collected from human prostates. The preliminary results show that the tactile device is sensitive enough to tell the differences of the stiffness of different tissues. The results also disclosed the factors (humidity, temperature and tissue degradation) which could dramatically affect the results of stiffness mapping. The tactile technology described in this paper has the potential to help disclose the underlying mechanical mechanisms that lead to increased stiffness in prostate tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22256325/,2022

Early detection of advanced field changes that can potentially progress to carcinoma can facilitate timely intervention and can lead to improved prognosis. Previous in vivo studies have successfully detected advanced field effects in oral cancers. Raman exfoliative cytology has previously shown to differentiate normal, oral pre-cancer and cancers. The present study explores Raman-exfoliative-cytology-based detection of field effects. Exfoliated cells were collected from tumor (n = 16) and contralateral-normal appearing mucosa (n = 16) of oral cancer patients, and healthy tobacco habitués (n = 20). After spectral acquisition, specimens were Pap-stained for cytological evaluation. Data analysis, by Principal Component Analysis and Principal Component-Linear Discriminant Analysis, indicate several spectral-misclassifications between contralateral normal and tumor, which were investigated and correlated with spectral, cytological and clinical outcomes. A qualitative analysis by grouping patients with number of misclassifications with tumor (Group 1: 0, Group 2: 1 and Group 3: >1) was explored. Group 3 with highest misclassifications showed spectral and cytological similarity to tumor group - one patient was a case of early inoperable residual disease, despite clear margins on histopathology. Thus, these misclassifications could be indicative of cancer field changes, and can prospectively help to identify patients susceptible to recurrences .",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//30719849/,2018

For this purpose, A total of 300 patients with colorectal polyps and cancerous lesions (192 colorectal polyps and 200 cancerous lesions) who were treated in the digestive endoscopy room of the hospital and underwent colonoscopy were selected, and they were divided into polyp group and malignant lesion according to the diagnosis results. groups, 150 cases in each group. There were 75 patients with non-adenomatous polyps and 75 patients with adenomatous polyps in the polyp group; 75 patients with high-grade neoplasia and cancerous changes in the malignant group. The microvascular structure and surface structure of the lesions were observed by colonoscopy, and the correlation between microvascular morphological characteristics and RhoC protein expression was analyzed. Results showed that the probability of positive RhoC protein expression in the polyp group was significantly lower than that in the malignant transformation group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In the malignant transformation group, the positive rate of RhoC expression in mucosal and submucosal superficial infiltration of 150 patients with colon polyp carcinoma was lower than that in submucosal deep infiltration, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).

The objective of this study is to investigate the role of SPARC in cancerization of oral squamous epithelium. Clinical specimens from 57 pre- and early cancerous lesion, 66 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and controls were immunostained with SPARC. Clinical features and SPARC expression were evaluated. Furthermore, effects of SPARC knockdown and overexpression were examined in oral cancer and keratinocyte cell lines. Leukoplakia, carcinoma in situ, and early invasive SCC had more SPARC-positive cells than normal mucous epithelium. However, there were no significant differences between leukoplakia, carcinoma in situ, and early SCC, and there were no correlations between SPARC immunoreactivity and prognosis of invasive oral SCCs. Cell proliferation was down-regulated by SPARC siRNA, and enhanced by SPARC transformed keratinocytes. But SPARC overexpression did not enhance cell migration activity. SPARC is induced by dysplastic cells in the early stage of cancerization, and may improve survival capability, but is not involved in malignancy.

We showed previously that global DNA demethylation increased with aging and correlated with genomic damage in CC, and we show now that preferentially associates to CCs with wild-type p53. This study aimed to elucidate the extent of DNA hypomethylation in patients with single and multiple CC, its relationship with aging, and its potential as predictive tool. We compared by real-time methylation-specific PCR the relative demethylation level (RDL) of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) sequences in matched cancer tissues and non-cancerous colonic mucosa (NCM) from patients with single and multiple right-sided CCs. Although no RDL difference was found in NCM from single CC patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.5), there was more demethylation (higher RDL) in NCM from synchronous cancer patients (P=1.1 × 10(-5)) multiple CCs also were more demethylated than single CCs (P=0.0014). High NCM demethylation was predictive for metachronous neoplasms (P=0.003). In multivariate logistic regression analyses RDL was the only independent predictor for metachronous (P=0.02) and multiple (P=4.9 × 10(-5)) tumors. The higher LINE-1 demethylation in NCM from patients with multiple (synchronous and metachronous) tumors (P=9.6 × 10(-7)) was also very significant in patients with tumors without (P=3.8 × 10(-6)), but not with (P=0.16) microsatellite instability. NCM demethylation increased with aging in patients with single tumors, but decreased in those with multiple tumors. Moreover, the demethylation difference between patients with single vs multiple tumors appeared higher in younger (P=3.6 × 10(-4)) than in older (P=0.0016) patients. These results predict that LINE-1 hypomethylation in NCM can be used as an epigenetic predictive biomarker for multiple CC risk. The stronger association of demethylation in NCM with multiple CC risk from younger patients also suggests an inherited predisposition for the apparent field cancerization effect of somatic demethylation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22310288/,2020

This is known as field cancerization, or a field effect and denotes a state of pre‑malignancy. Such alterations in histologically normal tumor‑adjacent prostatic tissues have been recognized as clinically important and are potentially exploitable as biomarkers of disease and/or targets for preventative/therapeutic intervention. The authors have previously identified and validated two protein markers of field cancerization: The expressional upregulation of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR‑1) and the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN). However, the molecular etiology of prostate field cancerization, including EGR‑1 and FASN upregulation, remains largely unknown. It was thus hypothesized that extracellular vesicles, notably exosomes, released by tumor lesions may induce molecular alterations in the surrounding tissues, resulting in field cancerization, priming the tissue, and ultimately promoting multifocal tumorigenesis, which is often observed in prostate cancer. Towards testing this hypothesis, the current study, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, presents correlative protein expression data, generated in disease‑free, tumor‑adjacent and cancerous human prostate tissues by quantitative immunofluorescence, between the exosomal marker CD9, and EGR‑1 and FASN. Despite the pilot character of the present study, and the static nature and heterogeneity of human tissues, the data suggest that CD9 expression itself is part of a field effect. In support of this hypothesis, the results suggest a possible contribution of exosomes to the induction of field cancerization in the prostate, particularly for EGR‑1. These findings were corroborated in established cell models of cancerous (LNCaP) and non‑cancerous (RWPE‑1) human prostate epithelial cells. The findings of this study warrant further investigation into the functional interface between exosomes and field cancerization, as a detailed understanding of this characterization may lead to the development of clinical applications related to diagnosis and/or prognosis and targeted intervention to prevent progression from pre‑malignancy to cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//32319557/,2023

In western countries, HCV infection is the main etiology underlying this cancer's accelerating incidence. To characterize the molecular events of the hepatocarcinogenic process, and to identify new biomarkers for early HCC, the gene expression profiles of 75 tissue samples were analyzed representing the stepwise carcinogenic process from preneoplastic lesions (cirrhosis and dysplasia) to HCC, including 4 neoplastic stages (very early HCC to metastatic tumors) from patients with HCV infection. We identified gene signatures that accurately reflect the pathological progression of disease at each stage. Eight genes distinguish between control and cirrhosis, 24 between cirrhosis and dysplasia, 93 between dysplasia and early HCC, and 9 between early and advanced HCC. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR, we validated several novel molecular tissue markers for early HCC diagnosis, specifically induction of abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly-associated protein, hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor, primase 1, erythropoietin, and neuregulin 1. In addition, pathway analysis revealed dysregulation of the Notch and Toll-like receptor pathways in cirrhosis, followed by deregulation of several components of the Jak/STAT pathway in early carcinogenesis, then upregulation of genes involved in DNA replication and repair and cell cycle in late cancerous stages.Conclusion:These findings provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of genomic changes in progressive HCV-related HCC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17393520/,2017

In 3 cases we performed a one stage surgery, in 1 case the chose was for a two stage surgery, for 3 patients we opted for an endovascular treatment by an endograft, in 1 case a pancreatic cancer was diagnosed 3 months after the prosthetic replacement of an AAA and there were no surgical indications because of the patient was in an advanced neoplastic stage.Results:There weren't any prosthetic infection or more serious complications. The endovascular treatments were performed successfully without complications after few days being followed by cancer's resection.Discussion:In case of this association the prognosis is related to neoplasm's stage. Timing depednds on the pathology that has the higher risk of short-term complication. Since Nineties author's reports in Literature about one stage surgery are more frequent, while now endovascular methods open new chances.Conclusions:One stage surgery is a safe option in case of association between AAA and cancer. We think that a good porpouse is the use of a vascular endograft in aneurysmal treatment followed, after few days, by cancer's resection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17139966/,2018

"Personalized therapy of sarcomas: integration of biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection.","Joseph A Ludwig, Joseph A Ludwig","An improved understanding of cancer's molecular diversity at the genetic, proteomic, and epigenetic levels has made it evident that ""sarcoma"" comprises more than 50 different types, each as unique as, for example, breast carcinoma is from colon carcinoma. Sarcomas exhibit characteristic differences in cell of origin, disease site, likelihood and site of metastasis, growth propensity, and chemosensitivity. Additionally, as many as one third of sarcomas harbor specific chromosomal translocations that can be used to discriminate one subtype from another. Although biomarkers can be integrated into clinical practice to improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment response, a number of challenges hinder their widespread use. This review addresses the current use of biomarkers for clinical oncology, with special emphasis on diagnosis, staging, and grading. It also discusses types of biomarkers that are emerging to aid selection of therapy for patients with sarcoma. Finally, we consider practical factors that appear to limit biomarker integration into clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//18778559/,2020

The first squamous cell carcinoma appeared on the skin 2 years after the first transplantation. Since 2003, at least two precancerous lesions or non-melanoma skin tumors have been removed surgically yearly. These cancers appeared predominantly on the sun-exposed skin, and were multiple. As these tumors could behave aggressively and prone to recurrence, complex treatment was applied, which included a switch in immunosuppressive drugs and the application of field therapies. The authors give an overview of these treatment options in relation to the case presentation, emphasizing that not only early detection and active treatment of the precancerous lesions and skin cancers are essential, but education of proper sun-protection methods and dermatology care are also important in order to avoid the development of these tumors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//27263436/,2021

The clinical endpoint is the development of multiple tumours, either simultaneously or sequentially in the same epithelial surface. The mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear; one possible explanation is that the epithelium is colonized by a clonal population of cells that are at increased risk of progression to cancer. We now address this possibility in a short case series, using individual genomic events as molecular biomarkers of clonality. In squamous lung cancer the most common genomic aberration is 3q amplification. We use a digital PCR technique to assess the clonal relationships between multiple biopsies in a longitudinal bronchoscopic study, using amplicon boundaries as markers of clonality. We demonstrate that clonality can readily be defined by these analyses and confirm that field cancerization occurs at a pre-invasive stage and that pre-invasive lesions and subsequent cancers are clonally related. We show that while the amplicon boundaries can be shared between different biopsies, the degree of 3q amplification and the internal structure of the 3q amplicon varies from lesion to lesion. Finally, in this small cohort, the degree of 3q amplification corresponds to clinical progression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//21506132/,2020

[Recognition of occupationalcancers: review of existing methods and perspectives].,"Stéphanie Vandentorren, L Rachid Salmi, Patrick Brochard, Stéphanie Vandentorren, L Rachid Salmi, Patrick Brochard","Occupational risk factors represent a significant part of cancer causes and are involved in all type of cancers. Nonetheless, the frequency of these cancers is largely under-estimated. Parallel to the epidemiological approach (collective), the concept of occupational cancer is often linked (at the individual level) to the compensation of occupational diseases. To give rise to a financial compensation, the occupational origin of the exposition has to be established for a given cancer. Whatever the method used to explore an occupational cause, the approach is that of an imputation. The aim of this work is to synthesize and describe the main principles of recognition of occupational cancers, to discuss the limits of available methods and to consider the research needed to improve these methods. In France, the recognition of a cancer's occupational origin consists in tables of occupational diseases that are based on presumption of causality. These tables consist in medical, technical and administrative conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the recognition of an occupational disease and its financial compensation. Whenever causality presumption does not apply, imputation is based on case analyses run by experts within regional committees of occupational diseases recognition that lack reproducibility. They do not allow statistical quantization and do not always take into account the weight of associated factors. Nonetheless, reliability and validity of the expertise could be reinforced by the use of formal consensus techniques. This process could ideally lead to the generation of decision-making algorithms that could guide the user towards the decision of imputing or not the cancer to an occupational exposure. This would be adapted to the build-up of new tables. The imputation process would be better represented by statistical methods based on the use of Bayes' theorem. The application of these methods to occupational cancers is promising but remains limited due to the lack of epidemiological data. Acquiring these data and diffusing these methods should become research and development priorities in the cancer field.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//16203270/,2022

Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive therapeutic method for multiple actinic keratosis (AK) with excellent outcome.Objectives:To evaluate the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical changes in human skin with field cancerization after multiple sessions of PDT with methyl-aminolaevulinate (MAL).Methods:Twenty-six patients with photodamaged skin and multiple AK on the face received three consecutive sessions of MAL-PDT with red light (37 J cm(-2)), 1 month apart. Biopsies before and 3 months after the last treatment session were taken from normal-appearing skin on the field-cancerized area. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed for TP-53, procollagen-I, metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tenascin-C (Tn-C).Results:All 26 patients completed the study. The global score for photodamage improved considerably in all patients (P < 0·001). The AK clearance rate was 89·5% at the end of the study. Two treatment sessions were as effective as three MAL-PDT sessions. A significant decrease in atypia grade and extent of keratinocyte atypia was observed histologically (P < 0·001). Also, a significant increase in collagen deposition (P = 0·001) and improvement of solar elastosis (P = 0·002) were noticed after PDT. However, immunohistochemistry showed only a trend for decreased TP-53 expression (not significant), increased procollagen-I and MMP-1 expressions (not significant) and an increased expression of Tn-C (P = 0·024).Conclusions:Clinical and histological improvement in field cancerization after multiple sessions of MAL-PDT is proven. The decrease in severity and extent of keratinocyte atypia associated with a decreased expression of TP-53 suggest a reduced carcinogenic potential of the sun-damaged area. The significant increase of new collagen deposition and the reduction of solar elastosis explain the clinical improvement of photodamaged skin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22329784/,2016

In squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT) which is infrequently linked to human papillomavirus infection, we have previously reported that clinically normal tongue contralateral to tumor (NTCT) is molecularly abnormal. Here, combining our transcriptomic and genomic data, we aimed to investigate the contribution of molecular changes in NTCT to cancer development.Methods:Microarray gene expression data of 14 healthy controls, 23 NTCT and 29 SCCOT samples were investigated to characterize transcriptional profiles in NTCT. Whole exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing data of paired NTCT and tumor samples from 15 SCCOT patients were used to study correlation between copy number variation and differential gene expression.Results:Using supervised multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis, a total of 61 mRNAs that distinguish NTCT from healthy tongue were selected. Functional enrichment analysis of the 22 upregulated genes showed increased ""positive regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process"" in NTCT. All 12 genes involved in this process have roles in apoptosis (anti- and/or pro-apoptotic). Compared to healthy controls, Zinc Finger Protein 395 (ZNF395), a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor located on chromosome 8p, was the only gene showing increased mRNA level in NTCT whereas decreased in SCCOT. Given the frequent loss of chromosome 8p in SCCOT, the impact of ZNF395 copy number variation on gene expression was further examined, revealing a positive correlation between copy number and mRNA level (correlation coefficient = 0.572, p < 0.001).Conclusion:NTCT is susceptible to malignant transformation, where tissue homeostasis is maintained at least partly through regulation of apoptosis. Loss of the pro-apoptotic gene ZNF395 could thus initiate cancer development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//39348078/,2022

Two protocols were randomly chosen. One side was treated with conventional MAL-PDT, whereas the other with laser-assisted MAL-PDT associated with acoustic pressure wave ultrasound with 1-hour incubation time. Actinic keratoses were quantitively measured, and the other signs of sun-damaged skin, like pigmentation and texture, in field cancerized skin were qualitatively evaluated before and after six months. Side effects were assessed subjectively during the procedure and one week after.Results:All patients completed the study. At six months after treatment, both protocols reduced the number of AK (72%; CO2 + PDT, and 65%; MAL-PDT). The difference between these two protocols was not statistically significant (p = 0.77).

Synchronous esophageal and colorectal cancers are also encountered with a certain frequency. A good prognosis can be expected if the tumors in both locations can be safely and completely removed. For patients with multiple cancers that occur simultaneously with esophageal cancer, it is necessary to perform a staged operation, taking into consideration the associated surgical invasiveness. It is also necessary to select multidisciplinary treatment depending on the degree of progression of the multiple lesions. We report our rare experience with a staged operation for a patient with synchronous advanced cancers of the esophagus and cecum who had previously undergone total gastrectomy with reconstruction by jejunal interposition for gastric cancer.Case presentation:A 71-year-old man with a history of reconstruction by jejunal interposition after total gastrectomy was diagnosed as having multiple synchronous esophageal and cecal cancers.

Immunohistological features of basement membrane formation of uterine cervical epithelium.,"K Tamura, K Tamura","The state of the basement membrane (BM) was investigated in the normal epithelium, dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix as well as metastatic lymph nodes by performing immunohistological staining for the presence of laminin (LN) and type IV collagen (CIV) and periodic acid-methenamine silver (PAM) staining of the BM. Moreover, to clarify the relationship between the epithelial cells and the BM, simultaneous staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed on the repaired tissue after punch biopsy. In the normal tissues, positive linear staining was observed beneath the epithelium with both PAM staining and LN.C IV staining. Some of the cases of dysplasia/CIS were continuously positive with PAM staining. However, there were sites which showed weakening and disruption of the continuity of positive staining for LN and C IV. As a function of the histological type of invasive carcinoma, the intensity of staining for LN and C IV decreased in the order of keratinizing (K), large cell non-keratinizing (LNK) and small cell non-keratinizing (SNK) histological types. However, no correlation was found between the stage of the carcinoma and the intensity of staining. In addition, the staining of the metastatic lymph nodes was similar to that of the primary lesion, and cancer foci that were in direct contact with lymphocytes were also stained for LN and C IV. During the process of reformation of the BM, LN and C IV were already present at the time when the epithelial interstitium was still negative for PAM staining. Moreover, at the time when the epithelial basal cells were PCNA-positive, LN and C IV could not be detected, and, conversely, when PCNA was negative, LN and C IV were detected. The BM is a structure which is formed when the interstitium is in a static state, and it was surmised that the production of LN and C IV is carried out by epithelial cells, including cancerous cells. Furthermore, it was surmised that the BM is not a structure which can prevent cancer invasion and the discontinuity or intermittency of staining for LN and C IV in cancers is a result of changes in the capacity to produce the BM components due to canceration of the cells.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8909054/,2023
[Expression of CD10 in tumor-associated fibroblast ofcancerizedor recurrent colorectal adenomas].,"Jiangjiang Zheng, Yin Zhu, Changshui Li, Yinya Li, Qianqian Nie, Ziling Zhu, Hong Deng, Jiangjiang Zheng, Yin Zhu, Changshui Li, Yinya Li, Qianqian Nie, Ziling Zhu, Hong Deng","Objective:To investigate the expression of CD10 in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) in colorectal adenomas and its relation to cancerization and recurrence of adenoma.Methods:Tissue samples of low-grade adenoma (n=50), high-grade adenoma (n=50) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (n=50) were collected, and tissue samples at the distal margin of corresponding colorectal lesions were taken as controls. The expression of CD10 in the stromal TAFs, and the expressions of β-catenin, Ki-67, p53 and CyclinD1 in tumor cells were detected by immunohistochemistry (Envision). The correlation of CD10 expression in stromal TAFs with the expressions of β-catenin, Ki-67, p53 and CyclinD1 in tumor cells was analyzed by Spearmen. One hundred samples of low-grade colorectal adenoma were collected, including 57 non-recurrent cases and 43 recurrent cases (16 cases of recurrent adenoma and 27 cases of recurrent adenocarcinoma); the expression of stromal TAF CD10 were determined and compared among groups.Results:There was no TAF in normal colorectal mucosa. The expression rates of TAF CD10 in low-grade adenoma, high-grade adenoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma were 22%, 50% and 78%, respectively (allP<0.05). The expression of Ki-67 and β-catenin in low-grade adenoma, high-grade adenoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma was on a rising trend (allP<0.01). The expression of CyclinD1 in high-grade adenoma was higher than that in colorectal adenocarcinoma and low-grade adenoma (allP>0.05). The expression of p53 in colorectal adenocarcinoma and high-grade adenoma was higher than that in low grade adenoma (allP<0.01). The expression of TAF CD10 was correlated with the expression of p53, Ki-67 and β-catenin-nucleus(r=0.264、0.307、0.320, allP<0.01),but not correlated with CyclinD1 and β-catenin-membrane (r=0.012、-0.073, allP>0.05). The TAF CD10 level was significantly higher in low-grade adenoma with recurrence than that in those without recurrence (P<0.05).The expression of CD10 in recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma was higher than that in recurrent adenoma (P<0.05).Conclusion:The expression of TAF CD10 is increased gradually in the process of adenoma-cancer, indicating that it may play an important role in the canceration of adenoma. Adenomas with high expression of CD10 TAF are likely to be recurrent and cancerized, and detection of TAF CD10 combined with p53, Ki-67 and β-catenin may be of value in predicting canceration or recurrence of colorectal adenoma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//27868405/,2017

Bowen's disease (BD), a premalignant condition, has a marginal potential (3-5%) to progress to invasive carcinoma. We report here a rarest of a rare case of multiple pigmented BD with overlying squamous cell cancer along with a giant neglected BCC on the scalp of a 76-year-old man. The occurrence of multiple BD and NMSC in a single patient compelled us to explore the following hypothesis: (1) The multiple precancerous and cancerous lesions can be due to common etiopathogenesis. Chronic ultraviolet exposure, immunosupresssion, human papillomavirus infection, dietary factors, and environmental factors including arsenic exposure were probed in to. (2) There is evolution of precancerous lesions into a different type of cancers in different time frame. (3) The new cancerous lesions are subsequent cancers that developed after neglected untreated primary cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//26458715/,2016

Genetic sequence variants and the development of secondary primarycancersin patients with head and neckcancers.,"Abul Kalam Azad, Isabelle Bairati, Elodie Samson, Dangxiao Cheng, Lu Cheng, Maryam Mirshams, Sevtap Savas, John Waldron, Changshu Wang, David Goldstein, Wei Xu, Francois Meyer, Geoffrey Liu, Abul Kalam Azad, Isabelle Bairati, Elodie Samson, Dangxiao Cheng, Lu Cheng, Maryam Mirshams, Sevtap Savas, John Waldron, Changshu Wang, David Goldstein, Wei Xu, Francois Meyer, Geoffrey Liu","Background:Secondary primary cancers (SPCs), a major cause of morbidity and mortality in head and neck cancers (HNCs), are commonly associated with field cancerization. We comprehensively evaluated 23 germline sequence variants (from published literature) in 17 genes from 7 biological pathways associated with the HNC survival. Because cancer prognosis correlates with disease aggressiveness, the factors that determine aggressive disease may influence field cancerization process to favor SPC development. We thus hypothesized that the same sequence variants associated with HNC survival can also be associated with SPC.Methods:Germline DNA from 531 stage I-II radiation-treated HNC patients (originally recruited for an alpha-tocopherol/beta-carotene placebo-controlled secondary prevention clinical trial) were genotyped, and analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by treatment arm, adjusting for clinical prognostic factors.Results:The majority of SPCs were of lung and HNCs. Median follow-up time was 5 years. SPCs were diagnosed in 21% of patients. The 5-year SPC-free survival was 79%. All but 1 evaluated sequence variant were not associated with SPC. There was a strong association of the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B) sequence variant, DNMT3B:C149T (rs2424913) with SPC: the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for TT versus CC was 2.23 (1.32-3.78; P = .003), whereas each variant T allele was associated with an aHR of 1.49 (1.15-1.95; P = .003).Conclusions:A functional sequence variant in DNMT3B is associated with the development of SPCs in HNC early stage patients treated with radiation. Aberrant DNA methylation may be an important modulator of SPC development in at-risk individuals with HNCs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22009713/,2018
Photodynamic therapy of malignant and premalignant lesions in patients with 'fieldcancerization' of the oral cavity.,"W E Grant, C Hopper, P M Speight, A J Macrobert, S G Bown, W E Grant, C Hopper, P M Speight, A J Macrobert, S G Bown","The management of patients with 'field cancerization' of the oral mucosa, with multicentric foci of invasion, presents a considerable problem for the head and neck surgeon. Surgical resection of synchronous or metachronous primary squamous cell carcinomas, along with adjacent premalignant lesions, is likely to be associated with considerable mutilation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be of value in the treatment of superficial tumours in the upper aerodigestive tract, with excellent healing of treated areas. This study reports the use of PDT to treat 11 patients with 'field cancerization' occurring in the oral cavity. Six patients had multiple primary cancers and five had single primary tumours. All had associated areas of leukoplakia. Each received Photofrin 2 mg/kg 48 hours prior to photoirradiation with 50-100 J/cm2 red laser light by surface illumination. Six to eight weeks later treated areas in 10 of the 11 patients showed a complete response to PDT; one patient had areas of residual leukoplakia. Two patients developed further areas of leukoplakia or erythroplakia within 12 months but no patient has had evidence of recurrent invasive carcinoma in the treated areas. Longer term follow-up will be necessary to exclude further recurrence. It is concluded that PDT offers an effective repeatable treatment option, whether on its own or as an adjunct to local excision, for patients with 'field cancerization' of the oral cavity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8289004/,2018

In this study, optimized biphasic ""immunofluorescence staining integrated with fluorescence insitu hybridization"" (iFISH) was conducted along the diagnosis-metastasis-treatment-cellular MRD axis to longitudinally co-detect a full spectrum of intact CD31-aneuploid tumor cells (TCs), CD31+aneuploid tumor endothelial cells (TECs), viable and necrotic circulating TCs (CTCs) and circulating TECs (CTECs) expressing PD-L1, Ki67, p16 and Vimentin in unsliced specimens of the resected primary tumor, EM, dissected sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and peripheral blood in an early-stage melanoma patient. Numerous PD-L1+aneuploid TCs and TECs were detected at the conventional safety EM (2 cm), quantitatively indicating the existence of a field cancerized EM for the first time. Contrary to highly heterogeneous PD-L1 expression and degrees of Chr8 aneuploidy in TCs and TECs in the primary lesions as well as CTCs and CTECs in peripheral blood, almost all TCs and TECs in SLNs and EM were homogeneously PD-L1+haploid cells. Dynamic monitoring and cellular MRD assessment revealed that, in contrast to PD-L1+CTCs being responsive to the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI-anti-PD-1), multiploid (≥pentasomy 8) PD-L1+and Ki67+CTECs were respectively resistant to ICI-sensitized T cells. In therapeutically stressed lymphatic and hematogenous metastatic cascades, stratified phenotypic and karyotypic profiling of iFISH tissue and liquid biopsied TCs, TECs, CTCs and CTECs in future large-cohort studies will enable appropriate re-specification of the optimal safety EM and distribution mapping of in-depth characterized, subcategorized target cells to help illustrate their metastatic relevance, ultimately improving risk stratification and clinical intervention of tumor progression, metastases, therapy resistance and cancer relapse.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//38971491/,2021

Methylation levels were analyzed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR of biopsied specimens from a training set of 255 patients and a validation set of 224 patients. We also measured traditional risk factors based on demographics, lifestyle, serology, genetic polymorphisms, and endoscopy. The methylation levels of four markers increased stepwise, with the lowest levels in normal esophageal mucosae from healthy subjects without carcinogen exposure, then normal mucosae from healthy subjects with carcinogen exposure, then normal mucosae from cancer patients, and the highest levels were in cancerous mucosae (P < 0.05). Cumulative exposure to alcohol increased methylation of homeobox A9 in normal mucosae (P < 0.01). Drinkers had higher methylation of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 and metallothionein 1M (P < 0.05), and users of betel quid had higher methylation of homeobox A9 (P = 0.01). Smokers had increased methylation of all four markers (P < 0.05). Traditional risk factors allowed us to discriminate between patients with and without cancers with 74% sensitivity (95% CI: 67%-81%), 74% specificity (66%-82%), and 80% area under the curve (67%-91%); epigenetic markers in normal esophageal mucosa had values of 74% (69%-79%), 75% (67%-83%), and 83% (79%-87%); and both together had values of 82% (76%-88%), 81% (74%-88%), and 91% (88%-94%).

In prostate cancer, identification of field cancerization has several potential clinical applications. However, prostate field cancerization remains ill defined. Our previous work has shown up-regulated mRNA of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR-1) and the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) in tissues adjacent to prostate cancer.Methods:Immunofluorescence data were analyzed quantitatively by spectral imaging and linear unmixing to determine the protein expression levels of EGR-1 and FAS in human cancerous, histologically normal adjacent, and disease-free prostate tissues.Results:EGR-1 expression was elevated in both structurally intact tumor adjacent (1.6× on average) and in tumor (3.0× on average) tissues compared to disease-free tissues. In addition, the ratio of cytoplasmic versus nuclear EGR-1 expression was elevated in both tumor adjacent and tumor tissues. Similarly, FAS expression was elevated in both tumor adjacent (2.7× on average) and in tumor (2.5× on average) compared to disease-free tissues.Conclusions:EGR-1 and FAS expression is similarly deregulated in tumor and structurally intact adjacent prostate tissues and defines field cancerization. In cases with high suspicion of prostate cancer but negative biopsy, identification of field cancerization could help clinicians target areas for repeat biopsy. Field cancerization at surgical margins on prostatectomy specimen should also be looked at as a predictor of cancer recurrence. EGR-1 and FAS could also serve as molecular targets for chemoprevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//22127986/,2020

The quantities of DNA in the normal and tumorous tissues were compared with those in the bladder cancer excised from man; and, the bladder cancer produced in the rat and that occurring in man were compared. 96 rats were divided into 4 groups, and given 8, 16, 24 or 32 weeks of treatment with BBN. Papillomas appeared after administration for 8 weeks, and with subsequent increase in the period of administration the rate of canceration increased. The cancerous tissue proliferated papillarily , the malignancy was grade 1 to 2, no case showed infiltration into the muscle layer, and the quantity of DNA scarcely changed with time, always showing a peak near 2c. In the papillary type of bladder cancer in man, the quantity of DNA showed little change at any stage, and little tendency of infiltration; and, the growth pattern was similar to that of the BBN-induced cancer in rats. On the other hand, non-papillary cancer in man showed a flat histogram of DNA, had a strong tendency of infiltration, and showed a growth pattern different from that of the BBN-induced cancer in rats, thus the BBN-induced cancer in the rat cannot be used as a model of non-papillary infiltrative cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//6677123/,2020

Such hypermethylation is also present in normal-appearing esophageal mucosae of ESCC patients and is considered to contribute to the formation of a field for cancerization. On the other hand, the presence of global hypomethylation in ESCCs or in their background esophageal mucosae is unknown.Method:We collected 184 samples of esophageal mucosae (95 normal mucosae from healthy subjects, and 89 non-cancerous background mucosae from ESCC patients) and 93 samples of ESCCs. Methylation levels of repetitive elements (Alu, LINE1) and cancer/testis antigen genes (NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C1) were measured by bisulfite pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR, respectively.Results:Methylation levels of Alu, LINE1, NY-ESO-1, and MAGE-C1 were significantly lower in ESCCs than in their background and normal mucosae. Also, in the background mucosae, a significant decrease of the Alu methylation level compared with the normal mucosae was present. In ESCCs, methylation levels of the two repetitive elements and the two cancer/testis antigen genes were correlated with each other.Conclusion:This is the first study to show the presence of global hypomethylation in ESCCs, and even in their non-cancerous background mucosae.

These syndromes lack distinguishing premonitory physical signs or biomarkers; therefore, in these genotypic settings, ovarian cancer risk must be assessed by analysis of the patient's pedigree. The authors describe 10 families showing a hereditary proclivity to ovarian carcinoma and/or associated cancer(s) in accord with their respective cancer-prone genotypes. Cancer education, genetic counseling, and surveillance should be instituted early. In addition to bimanual pelvic examination, ultrasound should be tested for its possible efficacy as a screening technique. The option of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy is thoroughly discussed with highly selected candidates.

In this study, we investigated the role of genetic instability in the development of HNSCC and in particular in tumour multiplicity phenomena of the upper respiratory tract. For this purpose, we analysed microsatellite instability (MI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 20 loci mapping on five chromosomal arms in 67 HNSCC patients, 45 of whom had a single cancer and 22 had multiple primary tumours. The possible involvement of the hMLH1 gene in genetic instability and as a potential target of 3p21 deletion phenomena in head and neck cancers was also investigated. Our data indicate that mismatch repair-related genetic instability plays a minor role in the carcinogenesis of HNSCC and in tumour multiplicity of the head and neck region. Moreover, our results exclude a role for the hMLH1 gene as a determinant of MI and as a specific gene target of deletion at 3p21 in HNSCC. We conclude that presumably other genetic mechanisms, such as those hypothesized for MI-negative hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer patients, may play a major role in the carcinogenesis of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//9820170/,2023

On healthy volunteers, the gastroelectromyograms from the gastric antrum showed spike bursts with equal intervals. On the other hand, in the patients with advanced cancers on which muscular layer was completely destroyed by the cancerous invasion, the gastroelectromyograms from the cancerous lesion showed no spike bursts. However, in the patients with mucosal cancers in which the cancerous invasion destroyed neither muscular membrane nor muscular layer, the gastroelectromyogram from the cancerous lesion showed spike bursts similar to those of healthy volunteers. From these results, it is proved that the deeper cancerous invasion disturbed the local motility at the cancerous lesion.

Oxidative DNA base modifications and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon DNA adducts in squamous cell carcinoma of larynx.,"Paweł Jałoszyński, Paweł Jaruga, Ryszard Oliński, Wiesława Biczysko, Witold Szyfter, Eszter Nagy, Lennart Möller, Krzysztof Szyfter, Paweł Jałoszyński, Paweł Jaruga, Ryszard Oliński, Wiesława Biczysko, Witold Szyfter, Eszter Nagy, Lennart Möller, Krzysztof Szyfter","Tobacco smoke, recognized as a major etiological factor for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, represents an abundant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are believed to play a significant role in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. An additional source of ROS in tissues exposed to tobacco smoke may be metabolic oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). To investigate the relationships between oxidative DNA lesions and aromatic DNA adducts, six modified DNA bases 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine and 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine and the total level of PAH-related DNA adducts were measured in cancerous and the surrounding normal larynx tissues (68 subjects), using gas chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectroscopy with selected ion monitoring and the 32P-postlabeling-HPLC assay, respectively. The levels of oxidative DNA lesions in cancerous and adjacent tissue were comparable; the differences between the two types of tissue were significant only for 5-hydroxypyrimidines (slightly higher levels were observed in the adjacent tissue). Comparable levels of DNA lesions in cancerous and the surrounding normal tissues observed in the larynx tumors support a field cancerization theory. The surrounding tissues may still be recognized as normal by histological criteria. However, molecular alterations resulting from the chronic tobacco smoke exposure, which equally affects larynx epithelia, may lead to multiple premalignant lesions. Thus, a demonstration of similar levels of DNA damage in cancerous and the adjacent tissue could explain a frequent formation of secondary tumors in the larynx and the frequent recurrence in this type of cancer. A weak, but distinct effect of tumor grading and metastatic status was observed in both kinds of tissue in the case of 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine. This effect was displayed as a gradual shift in the data distribution toward high values from G1 through G2-G3 and from non-metastatic to metastatic tumors. Since the levels of oxidative DNA base modifications tended to increase with the tumor aggressiveness, we postulate that the oxidative DNA lesions increase genetic instability and thus contribute to tumor progression in laryngeal cancer. No associations between aromatic adduct levels and oxidative DNA lesions were present, suggesting that the metabolism of PAH does not contribute significantly to the oxidative stress in larynx tissues, remaining the tobacco smoke ROS as a major source of oxidative DNA damage in the exposed tissue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//12688418/,2016

Based on this data, since 1981, 92 leukoplakias have been treated by out-patient laser surgery at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milano. The therapeutic technique was laser excision to obtain a specimen for histology. Two groups were distinguished according to the diagnostic procedure. Thirty-three lesions (December 1981 to December 1982) were operated on without preliminary histologic examination, on the basis of a simple clinical diagnosis. Since January 1983 all leukoplakias have been biopsied in a systematic way and those negative for cancer treated with laser. Histology of the specimen showed 5 squamous cell carcinomas (15%) in the group of patients who did not undergo preoperative biopsy. Postoperative histology showed malignancy in 6 of 59 (10.2%) cases in spite of negative preoperative biopsies. Speckled and erosive leukoplakias had the highest canceration rate. Three of 11 patients with cancer were treated by knife excision or interstitial needle implantation because of margins in tumoral tissue or because they were not evaluable for injury by heat.

Herein we developed a novel experimental model of field-cancerization and precancerous lesions (globally termed herein precancerous tissue) in the hamster cheek pouch to explore the long-term potential inhibitory effect of the same BNCT protocols on the development of second primary tumors from precancerous tissue. Clinically, second primary tumor recurrences occur in field-cancerized tissue, causing therapeutic failure. We performed boron biodistribution studies followed by in vivo BNCT studies, with 8 months follow-up. All 3 BNCT protocols induced a statistically significant reduction in tumor development from precancerous tissue, reaching a maximum inhibition of 77-100%. The inhibitory effect of BPA-BNCT and (GB-10+BPA)-BNCT persisted at 51% at the end of follow-up (8 months), whereas for GB-10-BNCT it faded after 2 months. Likewise, beam-only elicited a significant but transient reduction in tumor development. No normal tissue radiotoxicity was observed. At 8 months post-treatment with BPA-BNCT or (GB-10+BPA)-BNCT, the precancerous pouches that did not develop tumors had regained the macroscopic and histological appearance of normal (non-cancerized) pouches. A potential new clinical application of BNCT would lie in its capacity to inhibit local regional recurrences.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//19376711/,2022
[Expressions of Livin and PTEN inCancerousTissues of Ovary Endometriosis].,"Xing-Ya Liu, Hong-Jing Wang, Pan Xu, Jing Chen, Hai-Ying Pan, Ya Liu, Xing-Ya Liu, Hong-Jing Wang, Pan Xu, Jing Chen, Hai-Ying Pan, Ya Liu","Objectives:To investigate the expressions of Livin and phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromsome ten (PTEN) protein in the cancerous tissues of ovary endometriosis.Methods:Immunohistochemistry EliVision was used to examine the expressions of Livin and PETN protein in 19 samples of ovary endometriosis cancerous tissues, 30 samples of ovary endometriosis tissues and 30 samples of ovarian benign tumor tissues.Results:The positive expression rate of Livin in ovary endometriosis cancerous tissues (68%) was obviously higher than that in ovary endometriosis tissues (36%) and benign tumor tissues (13%)(P<0.05). The positive expression rate of PTEN in ovary endometriosis cancerous tissues (16%) was obviously lower than that in ovary endometriosis tissues (65%) and benign tumor tissues (80%)(P<0.01). There was no correlations between positive expressions of Livin and age, clinical stage, grading, histological type and lymphatic metastasis of ovary endometriosis cancer (P>0.05), the same result was also found for PTEN.

Aurora kinase A gene copy number is associated with the malignant transformation of colorectal adenomas but not with the serrated neoplasia progression.,"Laura Casorzo, Carmine Dell'Aglio, Ivana Sarotto, Mauro Risio, Laura Casorzo, Carmine Dell'Aglio, Ivana Sarotto, Mauro Risio","A crucial role for Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) gene has been demonstrated in the advanced steps of colorectal tumor progression. Little is known, however, about its role in the early phases of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Moreover, no data are currently available concerning AURKA involvement in the serrated tumorigenesis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to assess gene copy number and protein expression in 40 colorectal adenomas, 20 cancerized adenomas, and 20 serrated polyps. An increased copy number was found either in adenomatous tissue or in early cancer in the vast majority of cancerized adenomas, but only in 5% of adenomas (P < .001). Protein expression strictly paralleled fluorescence in situ hybridization results. No changes in the gene copy number were observed in serrated polyps, regardless of their histotype and the presence of dysplasia, even if high percentages of immunostained cells were detected in all the subgroups. AURKA gene is associated with progressive colorectal adenomas but is uninvolved in the development of nonprogressive adenomas. The diploid status of the gene is maintained along the progression of serrated neoplasia. AURKA protein expression in serrated polyps is uncoupled from gene status and is likely to reflect apoptotic dysregulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25596657/,2023
The dielectric properties ofcanceroustissues in a nude mouse xenograft model.,"Done-Sik Yoo, Done-Sik Yoo","The dielectric properties of various cancers, namely brain tumor, breast cancer, gastric carcinoma, and colon cancer, were measured in the frequency range of 500 MHz to 5 GHz. Cancers were cultivated applying the xenograft model of growing human cancerous tissues using the specific pathogen free, homo inbred mouse (a nude mouse). The complex permittivity was measured using an open-ended coaxial probe (HP85070B) and a computer controlled network analyzer (HP8510C). For the measurement of the dielectric properties, a total of 58 xenografted specimens was used. The results showed that measured values of complex permittivity for all four cancerous tissues were similar, with little variations over the frequency range used. It might be agreed that components and characteristics of different cancerous tissues would be similar despite their different occurrences in the human body. It is necessary to investigate this result further.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//15376246/,2020
Three synchronous HPV-associated squamous cell carcinomas of Waldeyer's ring: case report and comparison with Slaughter's model of fieldcancerization.,"Susan L McGovern, Michelle D Williams, Randal S Weber, Anita Sabichi, Mark S Chambers, Jack W Martin, K S Clifford Chao, Susan L McGovern, Michelle D Williams, Randal S Weber, Anita Sabichi, Mark S Chambers, Jack W Martin, K S Clifford Chao","Background:Patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx have an 8% to 20% risk of a synchronous or metachronous second malignancy.

A non-Darwinian role for mutagenesis in stem cell-derivedcancers.,"Ivan Bergstein, Ivan Bergstein","It is clear that mutations cause cancer. The implicated mechanism is Darwinism. That is, a stochastic series of mutations is purported to effect the cellular variability upon which natural selection acts to yield increasingly cancer-like intermediates leading ultimately to malignant clones. It is no wonder then that the neoplastic phenotype is considered ""alien,"" having evolved via random unrehearsed events. Neoplasia, however, has also been depicted as something less than foreign, bordering on familiar. This is because cancer shares proliferative and invasive qualities with the native developmental processes of embryogenesis and adult tissue renewal/repair. A question then arises: If key features of malignancy already naturally exist within well-choreographed programs, why reinvent this phenotype via stochastic multistep schemes rather than reactivate it largely en bloc? Indeed, as will be shown, tissues do harbor a malignant potential capable of reactivation. Specifically, this capability is maintained by stem cells (having inherited such from embryonic precursors)-a phenotype controlled by a microenvironment favoring perpetual rearing by (quiescent) stem cells of proliferative progeny for orderly renewal over neoplasia. Accordingly, normally well-sequestered stem cells, when amid carcinogen/mutagen-induced disruption to local surroundings, produce progeny tending by default toward disorderliness (neoplasia) over renewal. Because such tumor-causing mutations act non-cell autonomously, this cancerous state is potentially reversible but subsequent cell-autonomous mutations can impair particular clonal progeny, already cancerous, from regressing. Thus, a scenario wherein mutations (1) de-repress malignancy non-cell autonomously and then (2) slow its reversion cell autonomously, commonly misinterpreted as Darwinian, may constitute a non-Darwinian mechanism for the genesis of cancers that are stem cell derived.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//12503073/,2018

These findings were also confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. More strikingly, elevated expression of CK2α in thyroid papillary carcinoma tissues was not only significantly associated with lymph node cancerous metastasis and clinical stage of thyroid cancers; but also correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and high tenascin C (TNC) expression.

Animal models suggest that epithelial malignancies may arise as aberrant stem cell differentiation during tissue repair. We hypothesized that if bone marrow stem cells participate in human neoplasia, then solid organ cancers developing after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) might include malignant cells of donor origin. We identified four male patients who developed solid organ cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Kaposi sarcoma) after myeloablation, total body irradiation, and ABMT from female donors. Donor-derived malignant cells comprised 2.5%-6% of the tumor cellularity The presence of donor-derived malignant cells in solid organ cancers suggests that human bone marrow-derived stem cells have a role in solid organ cancer's carcinogenesis.

Objective This prospective, clinical trial was performed to evaluate the association of interleukin (IL)-10 promoter polymorphism variants and canceration and recurrence rates in vocal leukoplakia (a pre-cancerous laryngeal carcinoma lesion) over a 2-year period. Participants and method Sixty-one post-operative patients with vocal leukoplakia were enrolled in this prospective, observational study and genotyped for the IL-10 promoter gene (IL-10-1082 A/G, -819 T/C and -592 A/C) using pyrosequencing, and responded to a 2-year follow-up survey. Recurrence and canceration rates were used to evaluate the association between the genotype variants and the clinical outcome. Results There was an increased canceration rate in the variant genotype group compared to that in the normal genotype group in the 2-year follow-up period (18.4% vs 0%, p-value = 0.038).

The objective of the present study is to clarify the clonal origin of the second tumor with the p53 gene mutation used as a clonal marker.Methods:Of 794 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary resection for primary lung cancer from 1980 to 1993, 22 required second pulmonary resection during the follow-up period, with a median interval of 38 months. We examined 16 of these patients for mutations of the p53 gene occurring in exons 5 through 8 by the polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism method. Differential diagnosis was also made on a morphologic basis, considering the degree of cellular differentiation and cytologic subtypes.Results:Nine of the 16 patients analyzed had at least one p53 mutation in their tumors. We were thus able to make molecular diagnoses for these patients. The mutational status of the p53 gene was discordant in all nine patients, suggesting a different clonal origin despite the fact that six of them had almost identical histologic features.Conclusions:Analysis of p53 gene mutations was thus useful in distinguishing second primary lung cancers from recurrent tumors. The observed heterogeneity of p53 status was also in line with the ""field cancerization"" concept.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//9305187/,2020
Recurrences and second primary tumours in the head and neck region: differentiation by p53 mutation analysis.,"D Gasparotto, R Maestro, L Barzan, T Vukosavljevic, C Doglioni, S Sulfaro, S Piccinin, M Boiocchi, D Gasparotto, R Maestro, L Barzan, T Vukosavljevic, C Doglioni, S Sulfaro, S Piccinin, M Boiocchi","Background:Patients with head and neck cancer are at high risk of developing additional primary tumours in the aerodigestive tract as a result of field cancerization phenomena. In this context, the appearance of a new neoplasm often poses a problem of differential diagnosis between recurrence and new primary tumour. The differentiation between the two entities in essentially clinical and conventionally based on the histological and spatio-temporal relations between the two lesions; however, the validity of these criteria has still to be assessed.Design:To evaluate whether field cancerization phenomena may affect the clinical diagnosis of relapse/metastasis in the head and neck region, p53 mutation pattern was analysed in a series of primary tumours and corresponding recurrences/metastases. The rationale was that, since p53 mutations are a very early and polymorphic phenomenon, a recurrence/metastasis must retain the same mutation as the the primary tumour, whereas independent tumours are likely to display a different p53 gene status.Results:Molecular analysis provided conclusive results in 9 of 12 cases analysed. The clinical diagnosis of recurrence was confirmed by molecular analysis in 4 of these cases. In contrast, a differential p53 mutation pattern supported an independent origin for 3 presumed local recurrences and 2 lung lesions.Conclusions:The use of p53 mutation analysis as a clonality marker allowed us to ascertain the inadequacy of the current diagnostic criteria for the differentiation between a new independent tumour and recurrence/metastasis. These findings substantiate the relevance of field cancerization phenomena in the head and neck region and prompt the use of p53 mutation analysis as a fundamental tool to improve the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8624298/,2018
Potential role of mast cells in hamster cheek pouch carcinogenesis.,"Romina F Aromando, Miguel A Pérez, Elisa M Heber, Verónica A Trivillin, Víctor H Tomasi, Amanda E Schwint, María E Itoiz, Romina F Aromando, Miguel A Pérez, Elisa M Heber, Verónica A Trivillin, Víctor H Tomasi, Amanda E Schwint, María E Itoiz","During the process of activation, mast cells release products stored in their granules. Tryptase, a protease released from mast cell granules after activation, induces tumor cell proliferation through the activation of PAR-2 (protease activated receptor 2) on the plasma membrane of carcinoma cells. Chemical cancerization (DMBA) of the hamster cheek pouch is the most accepted model of oral cancer. However, there are no reports on the activation of mast cells during experimental carcinogenesis or on the correlation between mast cell activation and cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential effect of mast cells on the proliferation of epithelial cells at different times during the cancerization process. Paraffin serial sections of cancerized, tumor-bearing pouches were stained with Alcian Blue-Safranin to identify the different degrees of mast cell activation. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify BrdU-positive cells to study tumor cell proliferation. Mast cells were counted and grouped into two categories: inactive mast cells AB-S+++ (red) and active mast cells AB+++S- (blue). Mast cell counts were performed in tumor stroma, base of the tumor (connective tissue immediately below the exophytic tumor), connective and muscle tissue underlying the cancerized epithelium (pouch wall) and adventitious tissue underlying the pouch wall. There was a significant increase in the number of mast cells at the base of tumors (p<0.001) compared to the number of mast cells in the wall of the pouch and in tumor stroma. In normal non-cancerized pouches, inactive mast cells were prevalent both in the wall (AB:S=1:2.15; p<0.001) and in the adventitious tissue (AB:S=1:1.6; p<0.004) of the hamster cheek pouch. At most of the experimental times examined, the ratio of active/inactive mast cells (AB/S) in the wall approximated unity and even reverted. The ratio of mast cells was AB:S 1:1.05 at the base of the tumor and 1:0.24 in tumor stroma (p<0.001). The evaluation of epithelial nuclei labeled for BrdU revealed a statistically significant increase in cells undergoing DNA synthesis in the epithelium of the wall of the cancerized pouch compared to control (p<0.017). Tumor parenchyma exhibited a highly statistically significant increase in DNA synthesis compared to control (p<0.001) and compared to the epithelium of the wall of the cancerized pouch (p<0.036). We conclude that mast cell activation in this model is associated to the increase in tumor cell proliferation, conceivably mediated by the release of tryptase.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//18396447/,2022
Tubular adenosis of the breast. A distinctive benign lesion mimicking invasive carcinoma.,"K C Lee, J K Chan, E Gwi, K C Lee, J K Chan, E Gwi","Tubular adenosis, a term first coined by Oberman, is an uncommon benign lesion of the breast that may mimic invasive carcinoma. There is no formal description of this condition in the literature. We report the findings on six specimens from five patients (one with bilateral disease), including three that showed cancerization by intraductal carcinoma (DCIS). The ages of the patients ranged from 40 to 82 years. One patient presented with a 3-cm breast mass, and the others were found in specimens resected for infiltrating ductal carcinoma (two specimens) or DCIS (three specimens). The histologic hallmark of tubular adenosis was haphazard proliferation of elongated tubules that were noncrowded, narrow, and sometimes branching. There was no lobular arrangement or, at most, vague lobular grouping, with some tubules often extending into the fat. The tubules contained basophilic or granular eosinophilic secretion. The stroma was sclerotic to edematous. The tubules were lined by bland-looking ductal cells and were surrounded by an intact myoepithelial layer, a phenomenon well highlighted by immunostaining for muscle-specific actin (HHF-35) or S-100 protein. In three specimens, the tubular adenosis was cancerized by noncomedo DCIS, producing a pattern strongly mimicking infiltrating carcinoma; the in situ nature of the carcinoma was confirmed by actin immunoreactivity in the residual myoepithelium as well as by the presence of architecturally similar tubular adenosis in the vicinity. Tubular adenosis shows an infiltrative growth similar to microglandular adenosis and adenomyoepithelial adenosis, but it differs from them by the interdigitating tubular configuration and also differs from microglandular adenosis by the presence of myoepithelium. Tubular adenosis can be distinguished from sclerosing adenosis by the lack of obvious lobular architecture or whorled arrangement and wider separation of the tubules. Tubular adenosis appears to be a benign lesion per se, but whether it has premalignant potential remains to be determined. The importance of recognizing this entity lies in its being potentially mistaken for invasive carcinoma, especially at intraoperative frozen section or when the lesion is cancerized by DCIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8540608/,2023
Increased expression of fascin associated with malignant transformation of sinonasal inverted papilloma.,"An-liu Wang, Hong-gang Liu, Yong Zhang, An-liu Wang, Hong-gang Liu, Yong Zhang","Background:Fascin, an actin binding protein, usually expressed at a low level in normal epithelium, but is significantly increased in transformed epithelial cells and several common carcinomas. In this study, we examined the expression of fascin by immunohistochemistry in sinonasal epithelium with chronic inflammation (control group), exophytic papilloma (EP), inverted papilloma (IP) with dysplasia and cancerated IP (including carcinoma in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma, SCC), and furthermore investigated the relationship between fascin expression and formation of malignant IP.Methods:Fascin expression was immunohistochemically detected using monoclonal antibody against fascin in 86 paraffin embedded tissues, including 10 cases of sinonasal mucosa with chronic inflammation, 10 of EP, 45 of IP with dysplasia (45 cases were divided into three groups: IP with mild dysplasia, IP with moderate dysplasia, and IP with severe dysplasia, 15 cases each), and 21 of cancerated IP.Results:The level of fascin expression was significantly higher in the neoplastic tissue than that in control group. Fascin expression increased gradually with the progression from sinonasal epithelium with chronic inflammation, IP with mild dysplasia, IP with moderate dysplasia, IP with severe dysplasia, to cancerated IP, and significant difference of fascin expression was observed between any two groups of the five.Conclusion:Precancerous lesions of IP exhibit elevated levels of fascin that may be associated with carcinogenesis of IP.

When is precancerous actually postcancerous?,"I Bergstein, I Bergstein","Demonstration that certain rare cancer-related mutations can (i) be shared by adjoining benign and cancerous tumor regions or (ii) be present solely in a cancerous but not in an adjoining benign tumor region are data often cited in strong support of the conventional idea that benign tumor regions consist of precancerous cells. However, considering the well-documented evidence that many malignant cell types are still capable of regression through differentiation, one can envisage an alternative (or coincident) scenario whereby (i) mutations are shared by adjoining benign and cancerous tumor regions because a cancer cell with a non-differentiation-impairing mutation differentiates into a benign (postcancerous) cell or (ii) mutations are present solely in a cancerous tumor region because a cancer cell acquires a differentiation-impairing mutation that prevents its regression into a benign cell. Only with higher-resolution lineage analyses of a type not yet performed but experimentally feasible can these scenarios be distinguished. Accordingly, it is quite possible that common cancers regularly differentiate, such that a benign tumor region may actually harbor not only precancerous but also postcancerous cells. Demonstration of this phenomenon and elucidation of its mechanism could lead to novel therapeutics designed to effect reversion of the more common cancers that, when in advanced stages, are notoriously inadequately treated by current cytotoxic regimens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//11108657/,2017

This could be due to either a multifocal presentation of the same tumour, or different neoplasms arising simultaneously in a dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus ('field cancerization'). This is a report of the genetic analysis of multiple neoplastic sites in a Barrett's oesophagus with an extensive area of dysplasia. In addition, the dysplastic Barrett's epithelium was evaluated. For the genetic screening, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allowed evaluation of the whole genome of each specimen. Five cancerous regions were selected and subsequently dissected from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. The use of archival materials enabled a targeted collection of representative tumour locations. Multiple genetic aberrations were detected by CGH in all cancer sites. Losses on 3p, 4, 7q, 18q, and Y, as well as gains on 8q, 9q, 12p, 13q, 17q, 20p and X, were found in each specimen. In four out of the five lesions, simultaneous losses on 9p, 15q, and 16q, with concomitant gains on 5p, 7q, and 10p, were disclosed by CGH. Adjacent high-grade dysplastic Barrett's mucosa shared the losses on 3p, 4, 7q, 9p, 18, and Y, as well as the gains on 5p, 7q, 13q, 17q, and X, thereby confirming its precursor status.

Histopathologically healthy tumor adjacent tissue might be considered as a cancerization field which is typified by genetic changes required for the development of cancer. Metallothionein (MT) is considered to be a protective and anti-apoptotic protein. The aim of our study was to evaluate the MT expression in head and neck squamous cells carcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma and their histologically healthy adjacent tissue.Materials and methods:We have sampled 29 tissue samples in total derived from head and neck cancers and 29 samples of their clear surgical margins, 33 breast adenocarcinomas and 33 clear surgical margins. Antibody recognizing MT-1 was used for immunohistochemical analysis.Results:MT expression was revealed in 85,7% of head and neck cancers and 94% of breast adenocarcinomas. It was found in all tumor adjacent tissue. MT expression was statistically significantly higher in tumor adjacent tissue than in cancer tissue in cases with the presence of lymph node metastases in both, breast adenocarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Generally stroma seems to respond to the presence of cancer by the expression of MT, even in tissues which normally do not express MT.Conclusions:MT might be a normal or protective reaction of healthy adjacent tissue to the presence of tumor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//16264399/,2017
Fibroblast growth factor-2 expression during experimental oral carcinogenesis. Its possible role in the induction of pre-malignant fibrosis.,"A R Raimondi, A A Molinolo, M E Itoiz, A R Raimondi, A A Molinolo, M E Itoiz","Background:The fibroblastic growth factor (FGF)-2 has been shown to induce angiogenesis in several tumor types. To date, the activity of FGF during the development of oral pre-cancerous lesions has not been analyzed. We herein evaluated the role of FGF-2 in the pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions in the hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model.Methods:Expression of FGF-2 and its receptors FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 was assessed by immunohistochemistry at different stages of the carcinogenesis protocol. Activity of FGF-2 isoforms was analyzed by Western blots.Results:Increase and abnormal localization of FGF-2 expression was evident in cancerized epithelium before it was possible to detect morphologic alterations. The changes in FGF-2 are concomitant with the evolution of subepithelial fibrosis. Immunolabeling of carcinomas was faint or completely negative. Increases of FGF-2 activity are mainly due to the increase in the 18 kDa isoform. Receptors 2 and 3 of FGF are present in epithelium, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelia of control samples and in all stages of malignant transformation.Conclusions:Our results would suggest a role for FGF-2 in the epithelium-connective interactions and a deregulation of its expression in the early stages of oral cancerization. In pre-cancerous tissue FGF-2 would play a central role in the development of fibrosis and a more collateral role in the induction of angiogenesis. The data would indicate its involvement in the process via the 18 kDa isoform.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//16519768/,2019
FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ON THE CAUSE OF SEQUENTIAL NEOPLASTIC CHANGES. THE EFFECTS OF 20-METHYLCHOLANTHRENE ON TRANSPLANTED EPIDERMAL MOUSE PAPILLOMAS AND THE DERIVATIVE CARCINOMAS.,"J S HENDERSON, P ROUS, J S HENDERSON, P ROUS","When crystalline 20-methylcholanthrene (MC) and the cells of tar-induced mouse papillomas (paps.) are injected together into the thigh muscles of mice the carcinogen exerts a marked promoting and chemotactic influence upon the cells while it is dissolving in the tissue fluid. Under such circumstances it strongly stimulates and attracts them, with result they surround and include the scattered crystals in small cysts that later coalesce to form a larger one from which the MC only very gradually escapes. Because of these findings intramuscular tests were made to learn whether MC would hasten the occurrence or increase the number of cancers that now and again derive from paps.; but the tests were repeatedly marred by the extraordinary behavior of such cancerous cells as happened to be already present in the implanted material. They responded far more actively to MC than did the pap. cells and soon took over the growths. Some carcinomas which failed to grow when transplanted alone, or only gradually formed small, regressing nodules, gave rise rapidly to huge growths of similar sort when exposed to MC. To exclude cancerous cells so far as possible from the later tests small grafts of pap. tissue with MC crystals adhering to them were implanted subcutaneously. The pap. cells promptly lined the graft pockets, encysting the crystals incidentally, and formed tumors that enlarged progressively by keratinizing inwards. While they did this their living layer of pap. tissue was continually bathed in dissolved MC throughout many weeks. Despite these apparently favorable conditions the carcinogen neither hastened the occurrence nor increased the number of visible epidermal cancers deriving from the paps. It also failed to bring about sequential malignant changes in the carcinomas. These negative results accord with those already obtained through long exposure of the benign pulmonary adenomas of mice to urethane or methylcholanthrene, agents which rapidly induce these benign tumors yet which were found to be incapable of furthering the cancerous changes to which such growths are prone. They accord also with another previous finding, namely that MC fails to bring on the malignant changes of discontinuous, sequential sort that mammary mouse carcinomas often undergo ""spontaneously."" Taken together these facts indicate that the change or changes whereby normal cells are converted into benign tumor cells differ in nature from those taking place when they become cancer cells, as also from those occurring when cancer cells undergo further, step-like, malignant changes. A study has been begun to learn whether the widely various carcinomas deriving from benign papillomas differ from these latter and from one and other in their chromosomal content.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//14208248/,2023

This phenomenon has been related to the chronic exposure of the bronchial tree to carcinogens through a so-called ""field cancerization"" process. This study was designed to investigate at the somatic level the genetic basis of the field cancerization effect in patients having multiple simultaneous neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions of the lung. The pattern of specific genetic changes occurring with high frequency and in early stages of lung carcinogenesis including p53 mutations, deletions of chromosome 3p, and K-ras mutations, was investigated by immunocytochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular approaches in 11 synchronous lesions of five patients with multiple lung cancers. Different genetic lesions were observed in all of the pathological specimens analyzed from each patient. The pattern of these changes was different both in topographically distant or adjacent lesions and in tumors with the same histopathological diagnosis supporting their independent origin. The present data provide further evidence of the clinical relevance of the field cancerization process, and support the use of genetic markers in the differential diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis versus second primaries of the lung.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//7805023/,2021

Although CD10 was also identified in human breast myoepithelial cells, its availability of immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections has not been examined so far. In the present study, we demonstrated CD10 immunohistochemically on paraffin sections of both normal and pathological breast tissues, comparing its staining patterns to those of smooth muscle actin (SMA), which is now commonly used to highlight myoepithelium. CD10 was consistently positive in normal breast myoepithelial cells. CD10 also clearly highlighted myoepithelial cells in intraductal papilloma, adenosis, ductal hyperplasia, fibroadenoma, and phyllodes tumor as well as SMA did. In atypical ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, continuous, discontinuous, and totally negative stainings of both CD10 and SMA were noted, depending on foci of neoplastic cell nests. However, both stainings clearly demonstrated myoepithelial cells of cancerized acini, being useful in differentiating lobular cancerization from microinvasion. Because SMA was also positive in normal vessels and spindle-shaped stromal cells, CD10, which was negative in vessels, was useful in differentiating myoepithelial cells from thin vascular wall in intracystic lesions with delicate papillae. Although background staining of spindle-shaped stromal cells was also noted in CD10, the positive cell number was less, and the signal was weaker than that of SMA. The absence of myoepithelial cells in invasive ductal carcinomas was more clearly highlighted by CD10 than SMA. We concluded that CD10 could be another useful marker of breast myoepithelial cells on paraffin sections. Combination of CD10 and SMA will provide more sophisticated information about presence or absence of myoepithelial cells in confusing breast lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//11950913/,2018

Curative resections (negative resection margin and no extrahepatic disease) were attempted in all patients. Recurrence developed in 26 (63%) patients, with disease being confined to the liver in 16 (39%) patients. Ten of them (24%) underwent hepatic resection and make up the study population.Results:Ten patients (4 women, 6 men; mean age: 62 years, range: 50-82 years) developed recurrence confined to the liver at the median interval of 16 months (range: 5-34 months) after the first hepatectomy. In 6 patients the recurrent cancer(s) involved both the area near the resection line and remote sites from the site of the first hepatic resection. In 3 patients recurrent cancer(s) was located at sites remote from the first liver resection. In 1 patient the recurrent cancer was located in the same area as the original hepatic resection. Three formal hepatectomies and seven non-anatomical (wedge) resections were performed. The mean blood loss was 900 cc (range: 100-2700 cc); the mean hospital stay was 19 days (range: 8-34 days). There was no perioperative mortality. Morbidity was 20%. Four patients died of recurrent disease, with a mean disease-free survival of 13 months (range: 5-21 months). Two patients had a second recurrence resected at 10 and 24 months, respectively, after the second hepatic resection. One of these 2 patients had a fourth hepatic resection for hepatic recurrence and is still alive with no evidence of disease. Six patients are alive, 4 of them without evidence of disease, with a median follow-up time of 30 months (range: 22-64 months). Actuarial 4-year specific survival was 44%. Actuarial disease-free survival at 4 years was 18%.Conclusions:In appropriately selected patients, repeat hepatic resection for colorectal metastases is a worthwhile treatment.

In each of these sub-groups, 4 micropapilliform cancers discovered at the occasion of a histopathological test. The mean age of the patients carrying a noduliferous cancer is 36.5 years and the one of multiheteronodular goitre is 50. No particular risk factor was discovered. Mean age of the disease is 2.8 years as far as noduliferous cancers are concerned, and 8.5 years for multiheteronodular goitre. The anatomical and echographic characters are discussed. What demanded a surgery intervention is reviewed. Mortality during intervention is zero. Morbidity recorded 17% of unilateral recurrent paralysis and 50% of transitory parathyroid insufficiency. Extemporaneous anatomopathological test was contributing in 25% of the cases; definitive test revealed 25 (74%) papilliform cancers (of which 8 micropapilliforms) and 9 vesicular cancers (26%).

It is the seat of many well-known cancerous localizations that always need to be searched for on principle when face to face with any cancer. The endoscopic examination so conceived allowed the authors to find a cancerous association on the very level of the upper sero-digestive tract among 14 per cent of the patients; 4 out of these 14 per cent having oesophageal damages impossible to detect clinically on one hand, and often radiologically on the other hand.

It is thought that these second primary cancers arise independently following exposure to a common carcinogen by a process that has been called field cancerization. Since mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene represent a genetic alteration occurring during the evolution of premalignant lesions to malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract, we analyzed mutations in the p53 gene of patients with cancer of the head and neck who developed second primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract epithelium to test the field cancerization hypothesis. DNA was extracted from primary head and neck cancers and second primary cancers of 31 patients. DNA from exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was analyzed by the single strand conformation polymorphism technique to identify the locations of the mutations in different regions of the gene. DNA from 6 patients was also sequenced by the chain termination method to confirm the presence of mutations and determine the base substitutions. Twenty-one of the 31 patients had 1 or more p53 mutations. In all 21 cases the genetic lesions were discordant such that the presence or location of the mutations in the initial primary cancer differed from those of the second and third primary cancers. In each of the five patients with mutations in both primary tumors, the mutations occurred in different regions of the p53 gene. Of the other 16 patients, 8 had a p53 mutation in the first primary but not the subsequent primary cancer and the other 8 had no mutation in the initial primary but did have a mutation in subsequent primary cancers. Sequencing confirmed the single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and showed that 73% of the mutations were transitions. The discordant p53 mutations in second primary cancers arising in patients with primary epithelial cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract suggest that these cancers arise as independent events. These observations provide the first demonstration of a molecular basis for field cancerization effects in cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8453641/,2020

The integration of irradiation and surgery as the treatment for selectedcancers.,"W T Moss, W T Moss","Combinations of radiation therapy with surgery originated when the surgeon thought he had transected cancer. Unrealistic expectations, however, plagued these combinations until it was appreciated that the dose required to eradicate a given cancerous mass varied primarily with its volume and the associated oxygen tension of its cells. This helped to establish the rationale for combining irradiation and surgery and enabled the radiation therapist to more closely tailor dose needs to each specific clinical problem. Tailoring of dose remains crude. Our greatest errors continue to be attributable to poor definition of tumor extent and the underestimation of residual tumor volume. We need more precise information from the surgeon and pathologist along with greater knowledge of patterns of spread. To the degree that such added information becomes available, we have the means to increase loco-regional control rates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//7141917/,2019

However, we have obtained favorable results in treating advanced breast and stomach cancers with preoperative irradiation using a less-fractionated irradiation method with a large dose instead of the conventional fractionated one. We adapted this kind of radiation method to improve resectability and to enhance the antigenicity of the cancer cells so as to inhibit the suppression of the immune reaction in the host. After preoperative irradiation, we examined the resected specimen histopathologically. Remarkable cellular infiltrations, such as neutrocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells of the tumor nests were observed; and these cellular infiltrations, after preoperative irradiation, were more remarkable than the cases without radiotherapy or with conventional fractionated radiotherapy. These cellular infiltrations suggest participation of immunoreaction and we are convinced that this kind of preoperative irradiation could enhance positive immunoreactions.

DNA was extracted and amplified via nested-PCR with or without previous digestion by the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease Hha I. The products were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized through silver staining. The clonality of these samples was analyzed by showing the lanes.Results:Loss of polymorphism at the AR locus was found in all the cases with DCIS and in 10 cases (10/25, 40.0%) of peri-PM with ADH, indicating the monoclonality of the tumor. Twenty-four cases (92.3%) of the 26 cases with peri-PM and the 20 specimens of normal tissue were shown to be polyclonal.

A built-in co-carcinogenic effect due to viruses involved in latent or persistent infections.,"Lars-Georg Hersoug, José Arnau, Lars-Georg Hersoug, José Arnau","A new hypothesis for some cancers, which combines the chromosomal instability theories with a co-carcinogenic effect of viruses causing latent or persistent infection, is presented. The hypothesis incorporates the multi-step model of cancer and that pre-cancerous cells reach a state of chromosomal instability. Because of chromosomal instability, the genome of these cell lines will lead to changes from generation to generation and will face a remarkable selection pressure both from lost traits, apoptosis, and from the immune system. Viruses causing latent or persistent infections have evolved many different genes capable to evade the immune system. If these viruses are harboured in the genome of pre-cancerous cells they could provide them with ""superpowers"" and with genes that may assist the cells to elude the immune system. The theory explains why cancer predominantly is a disease of old age. Upon aging, the immune system becomes reduced including the ability to control and suppress the viruses that cause latent or persistent infections. The risk of cancer could thereby increase as the immune functions decrease. The theory provides new insights to the genesis of cancers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//17125934/,2020

A membrane-specific tyrosinase chelate: the mitotic regulator?,"J A Kharasch, J A Kharasch","Cancer's random, reversible, unstable transitions to ""normal"" structures imply their functional relation. Similar random, continuous, reversible oncogene ""mutational transformation"" also lacks a consistent hybrid. Positing cancer's ""mutationally altered genotype"" leads to medically foreign causes, qualities, inducers, suppressors, immune proteins, and viruses. Its random variation, however, opposes the functionally discrete, ordered, stable, irreversible hybrid variation and single-valued transforms of molecular genetics. There, ""causal mutational operators"" remain unspecified; only consistent single-valued DNA base and amino acid change, as ""transform operand"", are made explicit. A mitotically ""blocked"" (normal) and ""unblocked"" (malignant) stem cell ""phenotype"", operationally constructed from microscopic data, is therefore viewed within the homeostatic context of open-system enzyme-regulatory equilibrium. This functional, stochastic field distribution between ""structurally bound"" and ""freely dividing"" stem cell number discloses their putative regulatory mitotic-blocking factor. A tyrosinase complex, interacting by Cu2+-Fe2+ chelation with a proline hydroxylase divisional enzyme near stem cell ribosomes, maintains steady-state mitotic equilibrium. Based upon familiar medical, biochemical, and energy principles this confronts cancer's pigmentary-depigmentary signs, glycolytic metabolism, elevated serum tyrosinase, defective collagen production, exposed membrane binding sites, and tyrosine's recent growth control role.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//3112530/,2023

One case of atypical hyperplasia, 3 cases of cancer in situ, and 2 invasive cancers were identified upon histologic examination. Three women were lost to follow-up and subsequently developed invasive cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//3983528/,2016
"[Cancerizedphagedenic ulcers. A study about 19 cases observed in Dakar ""Hopital Principal"" from 1961 to 1976 (author's transl)].","J Y Lariviere, J Y Lariviere","Cancerization is the main complication of phagedenic ulcers which are frequent in tropical areas. The detection of the turn towards cancer is generally too late because of social and psychological conditions. Patients of this study were civil servants and had beneficial of a comparatively early detection. The clinical, radiological and pathological features are described and the importance of the control of lymph nodes is emphasized. The surgical tactic is discussed according to each situation but it must be as conservative as possible, even if the amputation is only delayed since lymphatic dissemination is late and amputation eminently dramatic in the african context.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//481182/,2022

Lesions preceding squamous cell carcinoma of the bronchus and multicentricity ofcanceration--serial slicing of minute lungcancerssmaller than 1 mm.,"N Nagamoto, Y Saito, M Sato, M Sagawa, K Kanma, S Takahashi, K Usuda, C Endo, S Fujimura, T Nakada, N Nagamoto, Y Saito, M Sato, M Sagawa, K Kanma, S Takahashi, K Usuda, C Endo, S Fujimura, T Nakada","A total of ten minute squamous cell carcinomas smaller than 1 mm were found in surgical lung specimens from 108 patients who had roentgenographically occult lung cancer. These minute lesions were detected by submitting, in all the 108 specimens, the whole bronchial tree to 2-mm-thick sequential transverse slicing which was then followed by microscopic examination of each slice on an H-E stained section. When a focus of minute carcinoma was found, the slice was further serially sectioned to study whether there were such carcinoma-related lesions as dysplasia or other atypical changes of epithelia, and when there were, the spatial relation of these with the carcinoma. It was demonstrated that all the minute carcinomas were closely associated with either dysplasia or what we call ""basal cells with marked atypia"", cells with markedly enlarged nuclei arranged in linear fashion on the basement membrane. The contiguity of these changes with minute carcinoma strongly suggested that they are lesions preceding overt carcinoma. Also, there were some minute foci of carcinoma, which, though not involving the entire epithelial thickness, proved to have already begun microinvasion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//8278985/,2022
